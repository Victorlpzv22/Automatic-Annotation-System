	    <segment id='0' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, just in case that someone see the recording after the live event,.</segment>
	    <segment id='1' features='semantic-density;sd-'>I have started with a quick overview of the Azure Security Centre.</segment>
	    <segment id='2' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And now I'm talking about the Azure security Azure Sentinel.</segment>
	    <segment id='3' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So as I was saying,.</segment>
	    <segment id='4' features='semantic-density;sd+'>a security information management system first collects all the information, then analyse this information against known threats database in order to detect threats.</segment>
	    <segment id='5' features='semantic-density;sd--'>But it goes beyond that,.</segment>
	    <segment id='6' features='semantic-density;sd-'>because using artificial intelligence solution.</segment>
	    <segment id='7' features='semantic-density;sd+'>it also investigate all of these logs, and all of these amount of data in order to get a quick response to new threats that can affect your network.</segment>
	    <segment id='8' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so this is a another solution that you can use, in order to protect all the deployments that you made.</segment>
	    <segment id='9' features='semantic-density;sd-'>that you perform on cloud.</segment>
	    <segment id='10' features='semantic-density;sd+'>In this case, on Amazon Azure cloud.</segment>
	    <segment id='11' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Another topic that is very important when managing security is the key management.</segment>
	    <segment id='12' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is something that appeared also couple of days ago, when if you remember when Jesús told you.</segment>
	    <segment id='13' features='semantic-density;sd+'>how to deploy a virtual machine, one of the actions that you perform was.</segment>
	    <segment id='14' features='semantic-density;sd-'>to create a symmetric key pair.</segment>
	    <segment id='15' features='semantic-density;sd--'>In that case, Jesús told you.</segment>
	    <segment id='16' features='semantic-density;sd++'>how to create that key pair in your local computer and then you need to upload the secret key, sorry, the public key to the to the to the Amazon, sorry, to Microsoft Azure platform.</segment>
	    <segment id='17' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, in my this was for this one virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='18' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Imagine that you have in your company, like let's say 30 virtual machines with a 100 users, and with the 1000 clients connected.</segment>
	    <segment id='19' features='semantic-density;sd--'>You can imagine that you will get a huge amount of keys that you need to manage in a proper way.</segment>
	    <segment id='20' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, there is a specific module in Microsoft Azure, that is the Azure Key Vault.</segment>
	    <segment id='21' features='semantic-density;sd-'>The Azure Key Vault is nothing and more nothing less than a key wallet,.</segment>
	    <segment id='22' features='semantic-density;sd+'>where you can store all the application keys, secrets, credential certificates, etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='23' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And then you can manage then using the groups that you have created in order to get also control of the access and authentication that we will review in some minutes.</segment>
	    <segment id='24' features='semantic-density;sd++'>The Azure Key Vault provide you with solutions to keep control of the secrets of the keys that you generate, also of the certificates that sometimes you need to install in your servers in order to provide security service like HTTPS etc and this is provide you by Microsoft using a specific set of hardware that is called the hardware security modules.</segment>
	    <segment id='25' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Hardware security modules is a,.</segment>
	    <segment id='26' features='semantic-density;sd-'>well it's not so novel solution because let's say that they have like 15 years or more, and that currently is included in almost all electronic devices.</segment>
	    <segment id='27' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Is a specific piece of hardware where you can always, let's say that is designed to generate and store sensitive content.</segment>
	    <segment id='28' features='semantic-density;sd-'>For example, a keys okay or or certificates.</segment>
	    <segment id='29' features='semantic-density;sd++'>If you have on Android or an iOS cell phone, they have both this kind of hardware security modules and all your keys your fingerprints etc., they are stored in the security models.</segment>
	    <segment id='30' features='semantic-density;sd+'>If the operating system of your cell phone is compromised in some ways,.</segment>
	    <segment id='31' features='semantic-density;sd--'>if someone stole your phone.</segment>
	    <segment id='32' features='semantic-density;sd--'>and using high level engineering tools.</segment>
	    <segment id='33' features='semantic-density;sd+'>get access to your mobile, in the worst case it will get access to your, let's say, to all your documents, pictures, chats etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='34' features='semantic-density;sd--'>But it never it is almost impossible, in security there is nothing impossible,.</segment>
	    <segment id='35' features='semantic-density;sd+'>but it's almost impossible to get access to your security credentials, your keys, your fingerprints, etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='36' features='semantic-density;sd-'>because they are stored in a specific security model.</segment>
	    <segment id='37' features='semantic-density;sd-'>This is something that is, as I said, is a it's very common nowadays in all electronic devices.</segment>
	    <segment id='38' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And it's also implemented in all the cloud data centers that Microsoft use for for Azure.</segment>
	    <segment id='39' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And finally, the last, a security service that you can use in Azure is what they call the Azure Dedicated Host.</segment>
	    <segment id='40' features='semantic-density;sd--'>As as, as I told you, in the very first day,.</segment>
	    <segment id='41' features='semantic-density;sd-'>and when I when we were talking about the cloud solution,.</segment>
	    <segment id='42' features='semantic-density;sd--'>if you remember, we compared the pros and cons of.</segment>
	    <segment id='43' features='semantic-density;sd+'>having deployments on your local premises, on your own data center and moving them to to public clouds like a Microsoft Azure.</segment>
	    <segment id='44' features='semantic-density;sd++'>One of the main drawbacks is that if you move either virtual machines, application services or any any other asset to the cloud, you are sharing host with a lot of Azure clients.</segment>
	    <segment id='45' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Of course, it is well protected and isolated in a in, let's say,.</segment>
	    <segment id='46' features='semantic-density;sd-'>in Tyre two level, in layer two levels okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='47' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, you cannot get access to another clients machines and data okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='48' features='semantic-density;sd+'>But for some kind of sensitive application or in other in other words, in order to meet a specific laws regarding data storage and data management.</segment>
	    <segment id='49' features='semantic-density;sd--'>sometimes your company or yourself, imagine that you are working with your thesis with a sensitive data.</segment>
	    <segment id='50' features='semantic-density;sd+'>like genomics or biometric data from users like XXrate or medical records etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='51' features='semantic-density;sd-'>and in Europe, we have the LGPv that is specific well the  GDPR that is a specific data protection regulation.</segment>
	    <segment id='52' features='semantic-density;sd-'>that put focus on data protection and if you are managing this kind of data you need to meet some requirements,.</segment>
	    <segment id='53' features='semantic-density;sd-'>One of the requirements could be that you cannot share host with other third entities okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='54' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So in that case or maybe for any other requirement,.</segment>
	    <segment id='55' features='semantic-density;sd++'>there is this specific solution that is dedicated host where you can select to deploy, let's say, a virtual machine in a specific host that is not shared within other Azure client,.</segment>
	    <segment id='56' features='semantic-density;sd+'>so you can be sure that in that host, only your virtual machine or your services or whatever you want to deploy are running.</segment>
	    <segment id='57' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So it's like a getting your physical server from your data center and go to the Azure Data Center, install the appliance and then you are you are that, okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='58' features='semantic-density;sd+'>It is true that you are not sharing the host, but remember that you are in a public cloud.</segment>
	    <segment id='59' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So at the end, you are sharing network and other kind of upper layers services.</segment>
	    <segment id='60' features='semantic-density;sd-'>But this is more than enough to cover almost all the law requirements or all the security requirements when dealing with sensitive data etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='61' features='semantic-density;sd--'>The problems is that, of course, it is more expensive.</segment>
	    <segment id='62' features='semantic-density;sd+'>than deploying regular virtual machines in shared host.</segment>
	    <segment id='63' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Also regarding scalability and.</segment>
	    <segment id='64' features='semantic-density;sd-'>, when you want to move a virtual machine from a specific location to to another or you want to copy or to replicate replicate that virtual machine,.</segment>
	    <segment id='65' features='semantic-density;sd-'>if it is deployed in a dedicated host.</segment>
	    <segment id='66' features='semantic-density;sd--'>t will take you more time and is not so easy as when.</segment>
	    <segment id='67' features='semantic-density;sd-'>it is deployed in a regular serve host, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='68' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, on one hand you have that you are isolated from other clients and on the other hand, you have that is not so flexible.</segment>
	    <segment id='69' features='semantic-density;sd+'>in times of scalability and reallocation of of resources.</segment>
	    <segment id='70' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Finally, another another good feature of these dedicated hosts is that you can select the time where updates are applied to your system.</segment>
	    <segment id='71' features='semantic-density;sd--'>I will recall one one slide two minutes ahead.</segment>
	    <segment id='72' features='semantic-density;sd++'>But if you remember when when we deploy premises, when we deploy services on Cloud premises, it doesn't matter the model if it was platform as a server infrastructure or or software, there was there was some kind of layers.</segment>
	    <segment id='73' features='semantic-density;sd++'>that were managed by the cloud provider in terms of hardware updates, software operating system, etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='74' features='semantic-density;sd-'>All the updates were managed by the cloud provider.</segment>
	    <segment id='75' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, it was transparent to you.</segment>
	    <segment id='76' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Sometimes these kind of maintenance activities involve run out times of your of your services okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='77' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So if you are providing a service to a third party and you have signed with that party and as SLA as Jesús told you yesterday,.</segment>
	    <segment id='78' features='semantic-density;sd+'>if you use Azure dedicated host, you can select your own maintenance schedule and you can decid.</segment>
	    <segment id='79' features='semantic-density;sd+'>kay, not in this way or not during Monday Friday or only on Mondays" or whatever okay, because at the end is your own host and you can decide when to update, when to apply maintenance activities.</segment>
	    <segment id='80' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Finally, another good point of these dedicated hosts is that you can also move all your license regarding software etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='81' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Because at that point, a dedicated host is not different from a host that you have on your premises.</segment>
	    <segment id='82' features='semantic-density;sd-'>The only difference here is that is not on your premises is in Microsoft data center.</segment>
	    <segment id='83' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So you can move all your software license specifically that Microsoft or any other software providers and you can reuse that license.</segment>
	    <segment id='84' features='semantic-density;sd-'>and you can save some some money here in order to pay the extra cost of the dedicated host.</segment>
	    <segment id='85' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so more or less this is a general overview.</segment>
	    <segment id='86' features='semantic-density;sd+'>of the of the security services that you can use inside Azure platform.</segment>
	    <segment id='87' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Let's focus now on how to protect the network connectivity.</segment>
	    <segment id='88' features='semantic-density;sd+'>We are going to see the different layers of defense in times of network security.</segment>
	    <segment id='89' features='semantic-density;sd-'>We are going we are going to review also what is or what are the network security sorry the network security groups.</segment>
	    <segment id='90' features='semantic-density;sd-'>We are doing here also our walkthrough and a practical assessment regarding network security groups.</segment>
	    <segment id='91' features='semantic-density;sd-'>We are going to review also how to create a virtual machine just to solve some doubts etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='92' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And then we are going to see also on other options that you can use inside Azure platform that are the firewall and the DDoS protection.</segment>
	    <segment id='93' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, so if you think in how to protect data from unauthorized access,.</segment>
	    <segment id='94' features='semantic-density;sd-'>you can you can see or you can imagine like a seven layers before you get the data.</segment>
	    <segment id='95' features='semantic-density;sd+'>If you protect a these six layers before getting access to data, then you will be in a in a good position to assure that your data is not compromised, but any any kind of attack okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='96' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, the very first, if we start from outside the perimeter to inside data, so, this is the core that we want to protect and these are the boundaries of our hardware platform.</segment>
	    <segment id='97' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, it will start from outside to inside the first one that we have is the physical security layer.</segment>
	    <segment id='98' features='semantic-density;sd++'>The physical security layer is the very first access point to the to the hardware platform okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='99' features='semantic-density;sd++'>So, in that case, the what the cloud provider does is to be sure that no no one can access your the hardware your your your service or our deploy okay and also is the first a safe one to your to that to the next to the next layer okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='100' features='semantic-density;sd-'>The second one is the identity and access.</segment>
	    <segment id='101' features='semantic-density;sd+'>In that way here we must focus to control access to the infrastructure and also to keep track of any any change that happened in the infrastructure.</segment>
	    <segment id='102' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Also is very common to use single sign on multi factor authentication.</segment>
	    <segment id='103' features='semantic-density;sd+'>and also as I commented before, to a keep track of any event and change that happen within the the access and the identity of person or people accessing the machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='104' features='semantic-density;sd+'>The first layer is the perimeter in this case we are talking about inside and outside the network boundaries of our our systems, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='105' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And here is where we can apply techniques.</segment>
	    <segment id='106' features='semantic-density;sd+'>in order to protect our network against denial of service attacks it etcetera etcetera.</segment>
	    <segment id='107' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Here is where firewalls normally are placed okay,.</segment>
	    <segment id='108' features='semantic-density;sd-'>between the the what they call the MZ, the the military zone.</segment>
	    <segment id='109' features='semantic-density;sd-'>and the outside and inside of our network okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='110' features='semantic-density;sd+'>In this case, the idea is to protect the network from external attacks, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='111' features='semantic-density;sd+'>The fourth layer is the is the network.</segment>
	    <segment id='112' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Here we have the network itself.</segment>
	    <segment id='113' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, the idea is here to limit the communication between the different resources, it doesn't matter if the resources are from one specific client or for another.</segment>
	    <segment id='114' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Also to restrict any traffic coming from the Internet unless that it is allowed.</segment>
	    <segment id='115' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So here what Microsoft ablaze applies is the politic of "denied by default",.</segment>
	    <segment id='116' features='semantic-density;sd+'>so everything is closed, everything is denied, no connection can be performed from outside from the Internet to our network, and we decide to to open.</segment>
	    <segment id='117' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is something that we are going to see in the in the throughout today.</segment>
	    <segment id='118' features='semantic-density;sd-'>The next layer is the compute layer.</segment>
	    <segment id='119' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Here, it is important to protect the access to the all the virtual machines.</segment>
	    <segment id='120' features='semantic-density;sd-'>For example, that we'll have deployed and also to implement endpoint protection to the to the device.</segment>
	    <segment id='121' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Here the the main tools is to check if the virtual machine are updated, if they are some malware running inside it, etc, etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='122' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Then we get to the application layer that is the very first layer just after the data.</segment>
	    <segment id='123' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Here when we expose one application to the Internet, we need to be sure that the application are secure and are free of vulnerabilities.</segment>
	    <segment id='124' features='semantic-density;sd-'>We need also to keep a the all the secrets, all the keys, all the certificates related to a specific application,.</segment>
	    <segment id='125' features='semantic-density;sd-'>in our a secure storage solution as the one that I have presented before with the HSM.</segment>
	    <segment id='126' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And finally, we must be we must assure that all the application development that we perform follows a secure design as a good design.</segment>
	    <segment id='127' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Finally, the data, this is, this is, let's say the the bounty when when someone attacks your your system, this is what they are looking for, is data.</segment>
	    <segment id='128' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Today 90% of of attacks go go against the data, okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='129' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So there was some time ago that they the normal attacks were the kinds of denial of service, okay, so the idea was to stop the the proper function of your servers.</segment>
	    <segment id='130' features='semantic-density;sd-'>to get your servers down.</segment>
	    <segment id='131' features='semantic-density;sd-'>That that was the the main target of attackers, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='132' features='semantic-density;sd-'>But currently what a hackers or what attackers are looking for is your data.</segment>
	    <segment id='133' features='semantic-density;sd-'>They they look for your data, not only to stole data, and then try to get some money with that data, you can think about credit card numbers, personal identification numbers, etc, etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='134' features='semantic-density;sd-'>But also the buzzword now in in these kinds of attacks are the ransomware attacks, that maybe you have heard about.</segment>
	    <segment id='135' features='semantic-density;sd+'>These kinds of attacks going your systems, look for your data and using various strong key, encrypt all your data and then ask you for money to provide you the key in order for you to restore access to your data.</segment>
	    <segment id='136' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So here we need to protect data that is stored in databases, in hard discs, in virtual discs, that we are using in virtual machines.</segment>
	    <segment id='137' features='semantic-density;sd-'>All the data that is stored in that application that we use in as software as a service, for example, the the office, a software application that you use, thanks to the agreement between UPM and Microsoft, when you are editing online documents, all of this data about the author, data itself I mean text that you are writing, etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='138' features='semantic-density;sd-'>is stored in the cloud.</segment>
	    <segment id='139' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So you need to protect to protect them also, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='140' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So more or less, these are all the all the layers that you need to protect when you want to be sure that all the cloud deployments are are secure.</segment>
	    <segment id='141' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And sometimes you need to show how secure your application are.</segment>
	    <segment id='142' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Because, your applications are, because maybe your clients or maybe the governments asked you for an audit.</segment>
	    <segment id='143' features='semantic-density;sd--'>in order to show how secure your systems are.</segment>
	    <segment id='144' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, so who is the responsible of any of these of any one of these layers?</segment>
	    <segment id='145' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Well, depends.</segment>
	    <segment id='146' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is the slide that I want to recall from the first day presentation.</segment>
	    <segment id='147' features='semantic-density;sd+'>If you remember, we were moving from local from local deployments, where all the layers were, were being provided in our premises.</segment>
	    <segment id='148' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And of course, we were responsible of all the layers, okay, from hardware to application and data, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='149' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And then we have the three cloud models:.</segment>
	    <segment id='150' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Infrastructure as a service, Platform as a service and Software as a service.</segment>
	    <segment id='151' features='semantic-density;sd++'>When we are using infrastructure as a service, the cloud provider manages all the tools, all the all the issues related with the hardware platform, so it involves networking Security, perimeter control, firewalls, etc etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='152' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And we were assigned to control security from virtual machine and above, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='153' features='semantic-density;sd++'>If we use platform as a service where we just deploy our own application, then the cloud provider manage almost all the layers set the application and data.</segment>
	    <segment id='154' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And finally, when we are using software as a service, I always mentioned the same example office 365, we are only in charge of data and access management okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='155' features='semantic-density;sd+'>If we move these let's say a responsibility model from a hardware server point of view to security point of view, we have that depending on the cloud model that we are using also the responsibility is changing, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='156' features='semantic-density;sd++'>So, you you can see in this picture that if we move through from the first scenario that we that was having all them all the deployment on our premises, we were responsible of assuring the security in your layers, and the on the other hand, if we are using software as a service,.</segment>
	    <segment id='157' features='semantic-density;sd-'>we only need to take care about who is connecting to our system.</segment>
	    <segment id='158' features='semantic-density;sd-'>what are the client endpoints,.</segment>
	    <segment id='159' features='semantic-density;sd+'>that is from where they are connecting, and finally, how we manage data;   if users can store data on cloud or they need to store data locally, etc, etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='160' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, we are going to review afterwards the different way to control access.</segment>
	    <segment id='161' features='semantic-density;sd+'>and what is called authentication authorization in order to control in order to to provide access management,.</segment>
	    <segment id='162' features='semantic-density;sd+'>because you can see that even if we are using software as a service that is the top layer model,.</segment>
	    <segment id='163' features='semantic-density;sd-'>we need to be we need to take care about who can connect and what can they do when when they connect okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='164' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, more or less this is a review of the cloud model related with the with the security aspects and who is the responsible for each one of these aspects.</segment>
	    <segment id='165' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So as I said before, there are different services that you can use inside the platform to protect specific layers of your deployments.</segment>
	    <segment id='166' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Regarding the network layer, we have several tools.</segment>
	    <segment id='167' features='semantic-density;sd-'>The first one is the network security groups,.</segment>
	    <segment id='168' features='semantic-density;sd--'>this we are going to perform our walkthrough right now, well in a couple of of slides.</segment>
	    <segment id='169' features='semantic-density;sd+'>nd network security group is a tool that we can use in order to filter network traffic inside and outside our cloud resources.</segment>
	    <segment id='170' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So we can protect who can access to our cloud resources and also we can decide what can our resources access outside the cloud platform.</segment>
	    <segment id='171' features='semantic-density;sd+'>For example, we can limit that some of our virtual machine can access Internet or not okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='172' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So we can decide that for a specific group of virtual machines maybe they can be accesses outside internet.</segment>
	    <segment id='173' features='semantic-density;sd++'>but they cannot get outside the cloud network connection in order to avoid software download etc etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='174' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay or the opposite okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='175' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So we can we can apply here rules in order to to set the environment about traffics, we can also add specific rules related with our subcription limits.</segment>
	    <segment id='176' features='semantic-density;sd--'>We can also use what we are going to review afterwards that is a specific policies.</segment>
	    <segment id='177' features='semantic-density;sd++'>or  specific what Azure calls blueprints that are specific network configuration in order to deploy our virtual machine etcetera in a faster way okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='178' features='semantic-density;sd-'>We can also apply different rules and we can assign different priority to the rules.</segment>
	    <segment id='179' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, the the traffic is evaluated following the same priority as we define and depending on that we can we can decide what what to what action must be performed.</segment>
	    <segment id='180' features='semantic-density;sd+'>This is not very different to what a firewall is, I don't know if you are familiar, if you are familiar with firewall configuration, this is more or less what a firewall, how a firewall is configured.</segment>
	    <segment id='181' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Indeed we have a specific cloud firewall solution within the Azure platform, that is something that they call a firewall as a service.</segment>
	    <segment id='182' features='semantic-density;sd+'>I already told you Monday that nowadays you can find everything as a service, but this is another example firewall as a service where do you don't need to install any firewall management software etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='183' features='semantic-density;sd--'>You just define the rules and then you decide what happens when one of the rules happens okay and one of the of these rules are meet okay are met.</segment>
	    <segment id='184' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And there is also a web application firewall that is something that is very used in in HTTP servers, okay, we in web service in web servers sorry,.</segment>
	    <segment id='185' features='semantic-density;sd+'>in order to decide which kind of content can be served to the clients, how we can control the clients connection etc etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='186' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, it doesn't matter the data, doesn't matter the the application that you are deploying on cloud that you will find out a specific solution.</segment>
	    <segment id='187' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Regarding denial of service protection, what Azure provides you is a specific layer that controls all the traffic coming from the from the Internet.</segment>
	    <segment id='188' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So it analyze all the traffic, it looks for a specific the always attack patterns, and if it detects that the some of these patterns have been or are being performed then stop the traffic.</segment>
	    <segment id='189' features='semantic-density;sd+'>and that traffic is not received even by your by your cloud network.</segment>
	    <segment id='190' features='semantic-density;sd-'>It is a stop before the network perimeter.</segment>
	    <segment id='191' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So you even notice that these kind of attacks are being performed against your your network.</segment>
	    <segment id='192' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, in brief, in order to protect all the all the layers, and to and to warranty that our data is safe, we need to combine different different solutions, all of them provided by by the by the platform.</segment>
	    <segment id='193' features='semantic-density;sd++'>We have firewalls, we have network security groups, we have a perimeter controls in order to protect our network against denial of service attacks and using the network security groups, we can also define which kind of traffic are what kind of traffic is allowed within and externally to our to our network.</segment>
	    <segment id='194' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so I stop talking now and let's move through a walkthrough just to keep more active the session.</segment>
	    <segment id='195' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And what we are going to do, we are going to review in some way how to create a virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='196' features='semantic-density;sd++'>We are going to create a network security group and we are going to define one rule that is to allow remote desktop connection to that sorry to that virtual machine Okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='197' features='semantic-density;sd+'>In that way we can check that our virtual machine is visible from outside and then we are going to define another rule in order to limit the access to the internet that the virtual machine has.</segment>
	    <segment id='198' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, sometimes it's very useful to forbid the virtual machines to get access to internet, okay, because you want to protect what you can do within this virtual machines.</segment>
	    <segment id='199' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so this is the the four steps that we are going to perform,.</segment>
	    <segment id='200' features='semantic-density;sd--'>I'm going to follow one of the walkthroughs provided by by Microsoft, let me paste here to walkthrough the link, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='201' features='semantic-density;sd--'>But my recommendation is that you follow my, my explanation now, I'm going to do in real time the walkthrough.</segment>
	    <segment id='202' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And if you find any trouble, or if you, if any action that I'm performing is not clear for you while I'm doing that action, just stop me and I can, and I can explain you what what I'm doing,.</segment>
	    <segment id='203' features='semantic-density;sd--'>I'm going to paste in the chat, the the walkthrough link.</segment>
	    <segment id='204' features='semantic-density;sd-'>this one, okay, so you can get a access to the to the walkthough and you should see that is walkthrough number 13.</segment>
	    <segment id='205' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And I'm going to perform all the all the steps here, let me going to show you the walkthrough in a glance.</segment>
	    <segment id='206' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So first, we are going to create.</segment>
	    <segment id='207' features='semantic-density;sd++'>a virtual machine, then we're going to create a network security group, we're going to assign that virtual machine to the network security group, we are going to allow remote desktop protocol connection from outside to our virtual machine, we're going to check and then we are going to disallow Internet connection from our virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='208' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so this is the walkthrough that I'm going to follow.</segment>
	    <segment id='209' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And the first thing that we need to do, of course,.</segment>
	    <segment id='210' features='semantic-density;sd+'>is to go to our Microsoft Azure portal, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='211' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So I give you just one minute to.</segment>
	    <segment id='212' features='semantic-density;sd++'>to connect to your Azure portal account.</segment>
	    <segment id='213' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And you should get a similar picture as I have here.</segment>
	    <segment id='214' features='semantic-density;sd--'>I recommend, I think that I did it, but I recommend you to Doc, the sidebar here because at least for me is quite useful.</segment>
	    <segment id='215' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And also to keep an eye on the dashboard.</segment>
	    <segment id='216' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Every time you get an overview of all your resources, okay, you can get a very fast link to your resources, you have a very interesting tutorials here, you have a link to the marketplace to the state use.</segment>
	    <segment id='217' features='semantic-density;sd+'>of the cloud of the Azure cloud system.</segment>
	    <segment id='218' features='semantic-density;sd--'>, I explained that the first day, I'm not going to waste time.</segment>
	    <segment id='219' features='semantic-density;sd-'>I'm just making time for you to connect.</segment>
	    <segment id='220' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And you also get daily recommendation here.</segment>
	    <segment id='221' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And indeed, this one is quite interesting, I'm going to just spend one minute here,.</segment>
	    <segment id='222' features='semantic-density;sd++'>these DevOps Starter option here is a very fast way if you want to deploy your own code, and run the code on Azure without taking care about virtual machine operating system installing SDKs or whatever.</segment>
	    <segment id='223' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so imagine that you want to perform an experiment for your thesis t.</segment>
	    <segment id='224' features='semantic-density;sd+'>you have the code in Python in local in your own machine, but you want to, to keep this code running.</segment>
	    <segment id='225' features='semantic-density;sd--'>for let's say, one week, of course, you don't want to do that on your on your own machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='226' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And then you can bring your own code here to to Azure Resource, and just paste the Python code here, define the experiment that you want to perform, and then you leave it XX.</segment>
	    <segment id='227' features='semantic-density;sd++'>So it's as easy as going to the DevOps Starter, you select whatever you want to deploy, you have .NET, for C, C sharp, no GS, PHP, Java, HDML, Ruby, Go, or Python.</segment>
	    <segment id='228' features='semantic-density;sd-'>You select Python, then you decide what framework, Okay, let's say Python.</segment>
	    <segment id='229' features='semantic-density;sd-'>We are going to deploy a function app.</segment>
	    <segment id='230' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And now the only thing that you need to perform is.</segment>
	    <segment id='231' features='semantic-density;sd+'>your GitHub account where your code is uploaded.</segment>
	    <segment id='232' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And that's all and then you can define, okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='233' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, this is just something for you to know, if you want to deploy in a very, very fast way, your own code.</segment>
	    <segment id='234' features='semantic-density;sd+'>and leave the code running here on Cloud.</segment>
	    <segment id='235' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so let's follow the walkthrough.</segment>
	    <segment id='236' features='semantic-density;sd-'>The first thing that we need to do is create a new virtual machine, this will be easy for you.</segment>
	    <segment id='237' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Either you right here virtual machine,.</segment>
	    <segment id='238' features='semantic-density;sd--'>and then you click here or even faster normally, you have in your I don't know what is not look, let me Okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='239' features='semantic-density;sd-'>, so I have a two virtual machine,.</segment>
	    <segment id='240' features='semantic-density;sd--'>they are stopped.</segment>
	    <segment id='241' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is something that I repeat a lot, but it's quite important to, to keep in control your credit.</segment>
	    <segment id='242' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So let's add a new virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='243' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Now we can review the, the procedure in order to create our virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='244' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And now subscription where we only have one subscription resource group.</segment>
	    <segment id='245' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And this is something that is quite interesting.</segment>
	    <segment id='246' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Talking about resources is to create a specific resource group.</segment>
	    <segment id='247' features='semantic-density;sd--'>For example, imagine that you are working in your thesis.</segment>
	    <segment id='248' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Item, one, okay, so you can create a specific resource group, do you reply here all the way to our machine, or the web apps or all the DevOps, whatever,.</segment>
	    <segment id='249' features='semantic-density;sd--'>and then it's very easy when you finish this experiment to remove all the resources related to this experiment, okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='250' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Or you can create a group for your thesis and another group for let's say, projects, or whatever.</segment>
	    <segment id='251' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so I'm going to create a new group here that it could be, for example, my group one okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='252' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Sorry, my group one.</segment>
	    <segment id='253' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, so I'm going to assign this virtual machine to this group.</segment>
	    <segment id='254' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Well, virtual machine name, it's a simple virtual machine, simple virtual machine 21, because I have another one called IDs.</segment>
	    <segment id='255' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Region, Western Europe is okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='256' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Image we are going to deploy here the Windows Server Data Center, okay, you have a lot of images to deploy in your virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='257' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So you go to the Windows Server, the 2019 data center, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='258' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, size, well you can decide here the decide...In the walkthrough, they recommend you to use the DS d2s, v2 v3. Okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='259' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Well, it's a large virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='260' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Indeed it's powerful is eight gigabyte RAM with two virtual CPUs and 16 gigabytes okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='261' features='semantic-density;sd--'>You can you can select less okay, but let's follow the walkthrough.</segment>
	    <segment id='262' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='263' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So this is the the size.</segment>
	    <segment id='264' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Well, we need to select on username for the administrators let's say, Azure user that is what they recommend just to follow the walkthrough, but you can select whatever.</segment>
	    <segment id='265' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Well the password, you can use whatever you want, but remember that it needs to be it need to have at least numbers, capital letters and special symbol Okay, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='266' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Now select known here okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='267' features='semantic-density;sd-'>This is important because this is what we are going to do but instead of allowing Azure to create these.</segment>
	    <segment id='268' features='semantic-density;sd-'>how to open this port in an automate way,.</segment>
	    <segment id='269' features='semantic-density;sd--'>we are going to manage by our own okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='270' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So you select here known.</segment>
	    <segment id='271' features='semantic-density;sd-'>and then we can move to the Network tab.</segment>
	    <segment id='272' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, this is okay, network.</segment>
	    <segment id='273' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, here we need to configure the NIC network security group.</segment>
	    <segment id='274' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so we need to click known because we are going to sell it afterwards our own security group.</segment>
	    <segment id='275' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, if we move to management we need to disable the diagnostic that the router machine performs when rebooting.</segment>
	    <segment id='276' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so we disable and that's all.</segment>
	    <segment id='277' features='semantic-density;sd-'>We can now review the virtual machine for to find any inconsistence.</segment>
	    <segment id='278' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Let me check, I have one policy.</segment>
	    <segment id='279' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is not for you.</segment>
	    <segment id='280' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Yeah one second.</segment>
	    <segment id='281' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is just a problem because I've been testing some things.</segment>
	    <segment id='282' features='semantic-density;sd-'>You can create your your virtual machine okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='283' features='semantic-density;sd--'>It is yes the... Yes.</segment>
	    <segment id='284' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Well, it takes some time to apply the policy so let me check.</segment>
	    <segment id='285' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, so virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='286' features='semantic-density;sd--'>I'm going to go faster now okay... okay... okay,.</segment>
	    <segment id='287' features='semantic-density;sd-'>now the walkthrough, boot disable.</segment>
	    <segment id='288' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And that's all.</segment>
	    <segment id='289' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Let me check if the policy has been applied or not.</segment>
	    <segment id='290' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Now, I need to wait some time.</segment>
	    <segment id='291' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So I will give you some minute to complete the the walkthrough.</segment>
	    <segment id='292' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is what you should do now.</segment>
	    <segment id='293' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Imagine that you have created the virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='294' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So now we need to go to create our network security group.</segment>
	    <segment id='295' features='semantic-density;sd-'>I'm going to create, it doesn't matter that I have no virtual machine created.</segment>
	    <segment id='296' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So I'm going to create a network security group.</segment>
	    <segment id='297' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So you can just write here "network security group" okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='298' features='semantic-density;sd--'>I have two already created but I'm going to create another one just to follow the walkthrough okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='299' features='semantic-density;sd+'>It doesn't matter if your virtual machine is still being created, you can jump to the network security group.</segment>
	    <segment id='300' features='semantic-density;sd-'>I leave the virtual machine to be created.</segment>
	    <segment id='301' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Let me check because there is one message in the chat.</segment>
	    <segment id='302' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so, and here, let's add a new security group.</segment>
	    <segment id='303' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Here we need to select a subscription.</segment>
	    <segment id='304' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Now, we only have one and a resource group.</segment>
	    <segment id='305' features='semantic-density;sd--'>As I told you, I like to create groups for any kind of experiment or whatever.</segment>
	    <segment id='306' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So I created this group, just before my group one,.</segment>
	    <segment id='307' features='semantic-density;sd-'>I'm going to assign these network security group to that resources.</segment>
	    <segment id='308' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So the name of the of the instance is the name that you want to, to use.</segment>
	    <segment id='309' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Here, they say my network security group secure, you can use whatever, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='310' features='semantic-density;sd-'>I'm going to use and this is for, let's say, virtual machines, RDB.</segment>
	    <segment id='311' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, and the region, Europe is what Europe is okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='312' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, this is fast.</segment>
	    <segment id='313' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Well, for me is the same, they are asking me for the policy, this is still ongoing, I'm going to go through that afterwards.</segment>
	    <segment id='314' features='semantic-density;sd--'>But when talking about security policies,.</segment>
	    <segment id='315' features='semantic-density;sd-'>it takes some time the policy to apply, it can, it can get up to half an hour, I have experimented on times when I don't know if.</segment>
	    <segment id='316' features='semantic-density;sd-'>maybe because the servers are quite overloaded.</segment>
	    <segment id='317' features='semantic-density;sd--'>but it can take up to half an hour, but this is something that I will give you afterwards.</segment>
	    <segment id='318' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So for you, this error won't be here on you should create the resource, okay, no problem, I have one resource already created here.</segment>
	    <segment id='319' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so, create the resource and you click here in your resource that you have just created.</segment>
	    <segment id='320' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, so, let me I'm going to delete this one just to... let me check what network.</segment>
	    <segment id='321' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, it's already assigned, okay, you will have everything blank, but I going to to follow the the procedure.</segment>
	    <segment id='322' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So you need to go to your secure group that we have just created, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='323' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And if you go to settings and network interfaces, you should have this blank okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='324' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And then what we are going to do is that we are going to assign this security group that we have just created to the network interface that our virtual machine has, okay, how we know the name of the virtual machine?</segment>
	    <segment id='325' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, this is something that I'm going to give you some help now.</segment>
	    <segment id='326' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So we have created the the network security group we only need to configure let's go back and check if our virtual machine has been created.</segment>
	    <segment id='327' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So we go to our home.</segment>
	    <segment id='328' features='semantic-density;sd-'>We can go for example to the dashboard and you can see here your virtual machines.</segment>
	    <segment id='329' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Let's go and you can see if your virtual machine is already created or not.</segment>
	    <segment id='330' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Could you please someone of you told me if your virtual machine has been created?</segment>
	    <segment id='331' features='semantic-density;sd--'>It just to wait or or to go ahead.</segment>
	    <segment id='332' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So if someone put in the chat if your virtual machine has been created I go ahead if not I can wait.</segment>
	    <segment id='333' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So are your virtual machine, yes?</segment>
	    <segment id='334' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so if you have it, I guess that the others take the same then.</segment>
	    <segment id='335' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, so we have the virtual machine created with all the features, let's go to networking, in settings to networking.</segment>
	    <segment id='336' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And then if you if you take a look here at the network interface, you can see the name of the network interface, okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='337' features='semantic-density;sd--'>That is this one that you have here.</segment>
	    <segment id='338' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, so for me is the name of the virtual machine and three numbers okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='339' features='semantic-density;sd-'>For you, the format should be the same.</segment>
	    <segment id='340' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So you can just copy the name okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='341' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Or note down or whatever you want.</segment>
	    <segment id='342' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And then yes, we can go back to our security to our network security group, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='343' features='semantic-density;sd+'>The security group, we have already created our network security group and then we need to assign this security group to our virtual machine network interface.</segment>
	    <segment id='344' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So we come here and let me I'm going to... you don't have this this network here because you need to introduce.</segment>
	    <segment id='345' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, you click in associate okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='346' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And then I have all my virtual machines associated already to my work security group,.</segment>
	    <segment id='347' features='semantic-density;sd+'>but for your case, if you paste here, the name of your virtual machine or you just on roll this box, you will find the associate network for your virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='348' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, so you select the the network, okay, you click here in okay and then you will find that your virtual machine network interface has been associated to that security group.</segment>
	    <segment id='349' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, every action that we take now to this security group will affect to all the associated network interface here.</segment>
	    <segment id='350' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Imagine that you have 10 virtual machines that you want to control or that you want to get access using remote desktop that is the example that we are going to perform today.</segment>
	    <segment id='351' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, the only thing that you need to do is assign all the network interfaces of your virtual machine here the 10 virtual machine network interfaces and then you only need to perform one action in the in your security group that will affect to all the virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='352' features='semantic-density;sd-'>You have inbound security rules outbound security rules, network interface you can create subnets etc etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='353' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So if we leave it as it is now, the for you there are no no rules okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='354' features='semantic-density;sd+'>I have one rule created but I can even remove here but let's keep it and let's try to access to our virtual machine using remote desktop from our local machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='355' features='semantic-density;sd--'>How we can do that?</segment>
	    <segment id='356' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Let's go back to our virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='357' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So this is a virtual machine I have just created.</segment>
	    <segment id='358' features='semantic-density;sd--'>I have to stop it.</segment>
	    <segment id='359' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Probably if you have just created the machine is up and running for you.</segment>
	    <segment id='360' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And the only thing that you need to do now is clicking in connect and selecting a RDP.</segment>
	    <segment id='361' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Give me a minute for my virtual machine to start please.</segment>
	    <segment id='362' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Today is quite slow I don't know.</segment>
	    <segment id='363' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Well, l remember that we are in we are in free accounts.</segment>
	    <segment id='364' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So this is not as agile as commercial but today is true that everything is quite slow.</segment>
	    <segment id='365' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So let me check if my virtual machine...</segment>
	    <segment id='366' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Yeah, it seems that this is 30.</segment>
	    <segment id='367' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Let me check...</segment>
	    <segment id='368' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, you should be able to see here a dialog where you can select the RDP protocol that is the remote desktop protocol.</segment>
	    <segment id='369' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Let me check what is happening with my virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='370' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Yeah, now it seems okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='371' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, it's started, connect, RDP okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='372' features='semantic-density;sd+'>This is the IP of your virtual machine, the public IP, this is the port number you can leave it like that.</segment>
	    <segment id='373' features='semantic-density;sd+'>You can either copy those fields to your RTP client or if you are running, if your local machine is Windows, then it's easier.</segment>
	    <segment id='374' features='semantic-density;sd+'>You just download the RDP descriptor file,.</segment>
	    <segment id='375' features='semantic-density;sd-'>you click here, you see that I have downloaded one file.</segment>
	    <segment id='376' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And if I open that file,.</segment>
	    <segment id='377' features='semantic-density;sd-'>it gets contact with my RDP client.</segment>
	    <segment id='378' features='semantic-density;sd-'>and I can click in Connect.</segment>
	    <segment id='379' features='semantic-density;sd++'>If you click now in Connect, you will receive an error message saying that you cannot reach that virtual machine because if you remember there is no open ports in that virtual machine so we cannot reach.</segment>
	    <segment id='380' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So let's see how we can solve that.</segment>
	    <segment id='381' features='semantic-density;sd--'>We can leave, we can leave it like that.</segment>
	    <segment id='382' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Forget about the virtual machine and get back to the network security Group and let's define that for the network security group that we have just created, we can we want to open a new inbound rule.</segment>
	    <segment id='383' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Inbound that is this one of here.</segment>
	    <segment id='384' features='semantic-density;sd--'>I'm going to delete.</segment>
	    <segment id='385' features='semantic-density;sd+'>I have login.</segment>
	    <segment id='386' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Yeah. Okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='387' features='semantic-density;sd--'>That's okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='388' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is something that we are going to see afterwards.</segment>
	    <segment id='389' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So you click in add, and then we need to fill in with all the items, okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='390' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, source whatever you can limit for example, we can if we open our virtual machine to be connected by any IP it means that anyone of you can connect to any virtual machine that you have created, okay, but we can limit.</segment>
	    <segment id='391' features='semantic-density;sd+'>If you say IP address, if you paste here your machine public IP address, then only your local machine will be allowed to connect but leave it at any because.</segment>
	    <segment id='392' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Destination any and now in here in Service, you have specific templates to allow services.</segment>
	    <segment id='393' features='semantic-density;sd--'>You can see that there are many services.</segment>
	    <segment id='394' features='semantic-density;sd++'>For example, email, SMTP or IMAP or POP3 related to email LDAP, email, email, DNS and we have here RDP okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='395' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, if you click on RDP automatically all the fields are selected for you.</segment>
	    <segment id='396' features='semantic-density;sd+'>The port that is this one, the protocol that is TCP.</segment>
	    <segment id='397' features='semantic-density;sd--'>and you want to allow or deny in that case this case we want to allow, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='398' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, it gives you here a recommendation saying be careful because if you open then the port will be exposed to the internet or blablabla, okay you click in Add, okay, and then you will see a line like this one.</segment>
	    <segment id='399' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Well, you can put whatever name you want okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='400' features='semantic-density;sd++'>It says that for port 3389, protocol TCP, for traffic coming from any IP address and the destination any IP address, you wanted to allow, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='401' features='semantic-density;sd-'>I forgot to mention about priority.</segment>
	    <segment id='402' features='semantic-density;sd+'>What is priority?</segment>
	    <segment id='403' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Priority means that you can see here that I have one, two, three, four rules applied to my inbound traffic.</segment>
	    <segment id='404' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So every time data packets arrives to my network, to a network interface that is associated to this security group, for each data packet, it will be analysed following these rules.</segment>
	    <segment id='405' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So the priority means the order of the rules to be applied.</segment>
	    <segment id='406' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And it is very important.</segment>
	    <segment id='407' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, because maybe you have here one rule that say deny everything.</segment>
	    <segment id='408' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And if the priority is very high, it doesn't matter what you put here, that since the first rule will be applied, all your traffic will be denied, okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='409' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So in the walkthrough, I recommend you to use 300 as a priority.</segment>
	    <segment id='410' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, we can do that.</segment>
	    <segment id='411' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so if we have created that inbound rule.</segment>
	    <segment id='412' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And we can go back.</segment>
	    <segment id='413' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, you need to open again the RDP file that we have just download.</segment>
	    <segment id='414' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Okay, Connect.</segment>
	    <segment id='415' features='semantic-density;sd-'>This is the credential that we have used when we created our visual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='416' features='semantic-density;sd--'>It was "azuruser", if I recall, well, let me check.</segment>
	    <segment id='417' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Yes, "azuruser" and the password that you created, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='418' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Let me check.</segment>
	    <segment id='419' features='semantic-density;sd-'>I think the firewall, yes.</segment>
	    <segment id='420' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, this is a security alert, you can click "yes".</segment>
	    <segment id='421' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And then we will get access to our virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='422' features='semantic-density;sd+'>This is the virtual machine that is running in cloud.</segment>
	    <segment id='423' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So this is my virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='424' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Well, the Server Manager is running, now, we can close this window is not useful now.</segment>
	    <segment id='425' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So please open the web browser and tell me if you're, if your virtual machine has internet access or not, you can click for example, Google, or whatever, whatever you want.</segment>
	    <segment id='426' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, and tell me on chat if you have internet access or not.</segment>
	    <segment id='427' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Or if you have any trouble connecting the virtual machines, you can also tell me okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='428' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So do you have Internet access from the web browser?</segment>
	    <segment id='429' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Is your virtual machine able to connect to Internet?</segment>
	    <segment id='430' features='semantic-density;sd--'>You will receive a lot of messages here.</segment>
	    <segment id='431' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Well, not Google. But you will receive a lot of security message here telling that... but you can click "yes" on any.</segment>
	    <segment id='432' features='semantic-density;sd-'>I have my virtual machine is restricted, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='433' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is what we are going to do now.</segment>
	    <segment id='434' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So you have access to the Internet.</segment>
	    <segment id='435' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So imagine that now, we want to disallow this virtual machine to access to the Internet.</segment>
	    <segment id='436' features='semantic-density;sd+'>We have opened, we have created a rule to allow inbound traffic to get to our virtual machine and thanks to that, we have been able to connect to our virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='437' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So let's try to limit the Internet connection of our virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='438' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Once again, if we go to our security group since the network interface of my of our virtual machine is assigned to the security group, every rule that we apply here will be apply to all the virtual machines that we have already associated.</segment>
	    <segment id='439' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So let "forbid" Internet access, okay, what we need to do here?</segment>
	    <segment id='440' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Well, you click in Add, okay, and going to do it with you, then you can go through Source and if you go to Source, you can again limit the IP addresses that you want to to limit, in this case, it doesn't matter any, you want to limit all the Internet connection.</segment>
	    <segment id='441' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So Ports, the same.</segment>
	    <segment id='442' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Destination.</segment>
	    <segment id='443' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Here Destination, we need to define what we want to limit.</segment>
	    <segment id='444' features='semantic-density;sd+'>We want to limit our virtual machine to connect to the Internet, okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='445' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So what is Internet?</segment>
	    <segment id='446' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Internet is everything outside our network.</segment>
	    <segment id='447' features='semantic-density;sd+'>It's quite difficult to define this in IP addresses.</segment>
	    <segment id='448' features='semantic-density;sd+'>But if we said here, Service Tag what Azure offered us is a very easy way to limit traffic depending on the network.</segment>
	    <segment id='449' features='semantic-density;sd+'>For example, we have virtual network to Azure monitor...</segment>
	    <segment id='450' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Every network that is defined has a Service Tag.</segment>
	    <segment id='451' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And in the same way we have a Service Tag that is called Internet okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='452' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, this is what we need to to follow.</segment>
	    <segment id='453' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Here in the in thein Service, you can select for example HTTP so you are limiting a only Port-80.</segment>
	    <segment id='454' features='semantic-density;sd-'>You can limit HTTPS whatever.</segment>
	    <segment id='455' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Or you can select.</segment>
	    <segment id='456' features='semantic-density;sd+'>For example, we can say that we want to limit every Internet port using TCP protocol.</segment>
	    <segment id='457' features='semantic-density;sd++'>So we are limiting every HTTP or HTTPS or whatever other connection.</segment>
	    <segment id='458' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Finally what we want to do is Deny, so this is the opposite we have said now.</segment>
	    <segment id='459' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Priority the same as I told you now, the lowest the number the highest the priority okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='460' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And the name that you want to assign to this rule, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='461' features='semantic-density;sd--'>For example you can put here Internet forbidden.</segment>
	    <segment id='462' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Well, we said that.</segment>
	    <segment id='463' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay you click in Add, okay, and it should appear here okay in your outbound security rules.</segment>
	    <segment id='464' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Once that your rule appears here, it is, you can check if it is a deny or allow action, so everything is okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='465' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And then you can go back to your remote desktop.</segment>
	    <segment id='466' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And then it should happen as me that my virtual machine now has no Internet connection.</segment>
	    <segment id='467' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So we have done for one virtual machine but is the same that I told you before.</segment>
	    <segment id='468' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Imagine that you have a bunch of virtual machines with only one rule, we are limiting all the access to all the virtual machines okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='469' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so that was the walkthrough that I wanted to to perform today.</segment>
	    <segment id='470' features='semantic-density;sd-'>This is also a recall of creating virtual machine etc etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='471' features='semantic-density;sd+'>You have seen also how to access through remote desktop.</segment>
	    <segment id='472' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is a machine that you can use now for whatever you want.</segment>
	    <segment id='473' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, remember that every time that the machine is up and running, you are consuming credit.</segment>
	    <segment id='474' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So my recommendation now, you close the Remote Desktop Connection, okay, and then go to the dashboard, go to your virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='475' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And you click on Stop.</segment>
	    <segment id='476' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay, and we stop our virtual machine and then we are not consuming credits.</segment>
	    <segment id='477' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, let me review the chat.</segment>
	    <segment id='478' features='semantic-density;sd--'>How you find any inconvenience any problem?</segment>
	    <segment id='479' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Or any doubt that you want to share?</segment>
	    <segment id='480' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So let me finish with the presentation that is almost finished.</segment>
	    <segment id='481' features='semantic-density;sd++'>Okay, so in brief, we have review, what it what is the issue Security Center, how we can manage keys and how we can manage logs and get a insights of our what is happening in our in our servers in terms of security, what are dedicated hosts, how defence can be applied using different layers on how Azur provides you protection against denial of service attacks.</segment>
	    <segment id='482' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So let me check if I miss anything from Module Four.</segment>
	    <segment id='483' features='semantic-density;sd-'>PEDRO- So, I'm going to give you the last presentation of the course.</segment>
	    <segment id='484' features='semantic-density;sd+'>that is related with privacy and authentication etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='485' features='semantic-density;sd--'>It should take no more than 25 minute.</segment>
	    <segment id='486' features='semantic-density;sd--'>In this for this presentation, I will not perform any walkthrough but I will recommend you to follow three of them that are very easy.</segment>
	    <segment id='487' features='semantic-density;sd--'>It's just to follow the step by step and that are related with the with the contents that I'm going to present you right now.</segment>
	    <segment id='488' features='semantic-density;sd-'>If you have any question regarding module four or the walkthrough that we have just perform, you can you can tell me now or otherwise, I will I will start with the module five.</segment>
	    <segment id='489' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so please write in the chat, if you have any question.</segment>
	    <segment id='490' features='semantic-density;sd--'>I'm going to share my screen in meanwhile okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='491' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, no questions.</segment>
	    <segment id='492' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, I will I will start the the presentation.</segment>
	    <segment id='493' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, we have reviewed in module four the basics about security.</segment>
	    <segment id='494' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And one topic that is related is how we manage the identity of the different users that we allow to manage our cloud resources, how we govern the difference and how we apply the different laws regarding data protection, privacy, etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='495' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And another tools to test the compliance of those laws.</segment>
	    <segment id='496' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, in brief, we are going to review the different identity services that are available in Azure platform, the different governance features that you can use for your own company and finally, the different privacy solution and compliance agreements that Microsoft has for the Azure platform.</segment>
	    <segment id='497' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, the identity service, we are going to review what is authentication and what is authorization for those of you who are not familiar with these two terms.</segment>
	    <segment id='498' features='semantic-density;sd++'>And then we are going to review the Active Directory provided in the cloud by Azure, the functionality of these active directory and finally, other access control mechanism like single sign on.</segment>
	    <segment id='499' features='semantic-density;sd++'>So, authentication and authorization, these are two words that maybe you know, but apply it to IT security, it has, they have different different meanings with authentication we control who is accessing any any asset okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='500' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, with the authentication service, we try to identify the person, the client, it could be also a machine, okay, that is a asking access to a specific resource.</segment>
	    <segment id='501' features='semantic-density;sd+'>We can do that using access credential, for example, a user name and a password and is the basic feature to start controlling the access to our resources okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='502' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Once that will have identify who is trying to access, if that person that server or whatever is Access Granted, then we can also control what this this entity is trying to is allowed to do in our to perform in our servers in our services, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='503' features='semantic-density;sd++'>So with authentication, we control who access and with authorization, we control what this person is able to, to do in the in the servers.</segment>
	    <segment id='504' features='semantic-density;sd++'>These are these two services authentication and authorization are the basics to control or to manage the roles that the all the persons in our company or external like clients or users etc are allowed to do in our in our in our services.</segment>
	    <segment id='505' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, let's see how we can we can provide these two these two services okay with different solutions that that we can use.</segment>
	    <segment id='506' features='semantic-density;sd-'>The first one is the multi factor multi factor authentication.</segment>
	    <segment id='507' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Normally you are you are used to provide username and password.</segment>
	    <segment id='508' features='semantic-density;sd-'>This is a two factor authentication.</segment>
	    <segment id='509' features='semantic-density;sd--'>You have a username that is something that that you that you know or something that you are depending in the in the how your organization has declared your your status okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='510' features='semantic-density;sd+'>But you provide the username password and if it match with the records that the company has for you then you get access okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='511' features='semantic-density;sd+'>But if you are using some sensitive service like for example, online banking, you know that they are also using a third factor authentication that could be for example, sending you a message to your cell phone and then you provide the code that is included in that message okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='512' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, in that in that case, you are using not only something that you know, that could be the password, you are providing something that you have, okay, in this case you have your cell phone because normally there's your cell phone, you only have access to it unless that someone have stolen okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='513' features='semantic-density;sd--'>But it's something that that you have.</segment>
	    <segment id='514' features='semantic-density;sd-'>There is another factor for authentication that is a something that you are okay something that you are is is something that you  and only you can provide.</segment>
	    <segment id='515' features='semantic-density;sd--'>For example, your your fingerprint, okay, your fingerprint is something that only you have and any any other person in the planet one have the same fingerprint as you as you have okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='516' features='semantic-density;sd-'>It can be your fingerprint, it can be your face or any other biometric property that you can imagine, okay, there are a lot of biometric properties that you can use.</segment>
	    <segment id='517' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, now we know three different a factors to authenticate who you are: something that you know, for example, the password; something that you have, for example, your cell phone or your your national.</segment>
	    <segment id='518' features='semantic-density;sd-'>ID card that is something that that you have okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='519' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And then something that you are that is any biometric property that you can provide okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='520' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, this is the multi factor and in Azure you can find solutions to provide each one of these different authentication factors.</segment>
	    <segment id='521' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So you can use or you can decide how your clients are connected or your or your members can connect to your to your services, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='522' features='semantic-density;sd-'>If you are familiar with IT services, probably you know what Active Directory is.</segment>
	    <segment id='523' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Active Directory is so old Microsoft solution to manage identity in corporation, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='524' features='semantic-density;sd+'>There is a specific deployment of these active directory in cloud that is called Azure Active Directory and that behaves in the same way.</segment>
	    <segment id='525' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, if in your company, you have an Active Directory already deployed, it's very easy to migrate from the local Active Directory to the to the Azure, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='526' features='semantic-density;sd+'>In that way you can provide authentication based on that directory you can provide single sign on, that is a specific solution to provide access to different services with only one sign on, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='527' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So you introduce the password only one time and then you get access to different service etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='528' features='semantic-density;sd--'>But what happens nowadays?</segment>
	    <segment id='529' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Well, currently, users are not fixed to a specific location.</segment>
	    <segment id='530' features='semantic-density;sd++'>You know and now in this pandemic times we have experimented in harder way that we can connect to our company network, on company premises, at home, using mobile devices etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='531' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, you can even decide depending on where the user is, where the how the user is connecting etc if you want to apply one a authentication factor two three, etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='532' features='semantic-density;sd+'>For example, if you detect that a user is trying to connect to the network with a computer connected using cable to your local area network.</segment>
	    <segment id='533' features='semantic-density;sd++'>then you can reviews the number of security measures that you want to apply because you know that he's inside the building so is difficult that someone gets inside etcetera, etcetera, but if you detect for example, that one user is trying to connect from a foreign country, for example, we are in Spain and we detect a connection coming from Russia for example, with a mobile device, then we can start deploying additional controls, because the risks are are higher than in the previous example that I have commented.</segment>
	    <segment id='534' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, the depending on these kind of scenarios, you can decide whether to apply higher or lower security measures okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='535' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, you can detect where the user is what is the device that the user is is trying to connect from, the application that is trying to use etcetera, etcetera, then you can decide the measures, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='536' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Well, regarding the the governance methodology,.</segment>
	    <segment id='537' features='semantic-density;sd--'>we are going to see here different solutions that you can apply and you have also walkthroughs to to some of them that I want to introduce you.</segment>
	    <segment id='538' features='semantic-density;sd-'>The first one is role based controls, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='539' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, role based is.</segment>
	    <segment id='540' features='semantic-density;sd+'>you know, because you are users of at least of one one organization that the that is UPM and you know that depending on your role, you can have access to some service and you can have access limited to to some others, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='541' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, in Azure, you can define different user groups, you can assign user to each kind of group and you can define policies to to define what user is allowed to do, depending on the group that it takes part, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='542' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is one control.</segment>
	    <segment id='543' features='semantic-density;sd-'>The other control is the Resource Locks.</segment>
	    <segment id='544' features='semantic-density;sd+'>These Locks are related not to roles but to specific resources.</segment>
	    <segment id='545' features='semantic-density;sd+'>For example, imagine that you deploy a virtual machine that is critical for your infrastructure.</segment>
	    <segment id='546' features='semantic-density;sd+'>It's a virtual machine that is taking care, for example of your firewall of your company, okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='547' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, you want to be sure that any of your IT staff remove that virtual machine accidentally okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='548' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, you can apply Locks.</segment>
	    <segment id='549' features='semantic-density;sd--'>You can go to a specific resource, you select the resource and then you apply Lock.</segment>
	    <segment id='550' features='semantic-density;sd--'>You have two types of Lock, the CanNotDelete Lock and the ReadOnly Lock.</segment>
	    <segment id='551' features='semantic-density;sd-'>You have here the features of these two locks.</segment>
	    <segment id='552' features='semantic-density;sd+'>If you select one virtual machine and you apply a CanNotDelete Lock, then users can read, can access to the virtual machine can update they virtual matching with new features etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='553' features='semantic-density;sd--'>But no one will be allowed to delete, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='554' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So, in this way you can be sure that no one delete.</segment>
	    <segment id='555' features='semantic-density;sd-'>This is something that you have seen when I tried to delete my virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='556' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Let me check if the new policy has been applied.</segment>
	    <segment id='557' features='semantic-density;sd-'>I'm going to review my virtual machines.</segment>
	    <segment id='558' features='semantic-density;sd-'>I have here this virtual machine and I'm trying to delete.</segment>
	    <segment id='559' features='semantic-density;sd--'>I have some policies.</segment>
	    <segment id='560' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And if you remember, before that I get an error message and now the policy is not applied and is being successful.</segment>
	    <segment id='561' features='semantic-density;sd--'>If you remember when just before when I tried to delete, it said let me check, anything they want..</segment>
	    <segment id='562' features='semantic-density;sd--'>ah no, this is the Lock.</segment>
	    <segment id='563' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Ah let me check, I have the Lock here.</segment>
	    <segment id='564' features='semantic-density;sd-'>This is why Locks are important.</segment>
	    <segment id='565' features='semantic-density;sd--'>not it's not here.</segment>
	    <segment id='566' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Okay but it's you can you can apply Locks and if let me check I think this one has a Lock, yes.</segment>
	    <segment id='567' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is what happens when you try to delete.</segment>
	    <segment id='568' features='semantic-density;sd--'>this was in this case a security rule that I decide to lock.</segment>
	    <segment id='569' features='semantic-density;sd-'>apply one CanNotDelete Lock, okay and then if someone tries to delay receive this message:".</segment>
	    <segment id='570' features='semantic-density;sd--'>The resource blah blah because it's locked" it said, okay "please remove the lock and try again".</segment>
	    <segment id='571' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Then if accidentally I try to delete this resource I receive a message.</segment>
	    <segment id='572' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Then I can decide and I can say okay, no no, I want to delete that security rule or or whatever.</segment>
	    <segment id='573' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, I can go to my let me check a the this one... Locks...  the resource, let me check...  It's not that one...  this is why if you have define different groups is easier to manage.</segment>
	    <segment id='574' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so I have here let me check if a have any lock... no and here...  yeah...  you see that for every resource I'm navigating, I can check if they have lock or not.</segment>
	    <segment id='575' features='semantic-density;sd+'>magine that you want to lock this network interface that I have here so No, nobody's able to remove this network interface because it's the network interface that gives access to Internet to my virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='576' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So it's as simple as going to lock apply Add Lock, you  just put the name, for example, not remove Internet nick.</segment>
	    <segment id='577' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So is the network interface that give access to internet and then I decide Lock type Delete.</segment>
	    <segment id='578' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Remember that we have to lock types Delete or ReadOnly so I select Delete, I apply okay, so now it has one lock.</segment>
	    <segment id='579' features='semantic-density;sd--'>It takes a couple of minutes so if I try to delete now these... let me check if it is already applied.</segment>
	    <segment id='580' features='semantic-density;sd-'>I'm going to wait a little bit.</segment>
	    <segment id='581' features='semantic-density;sd--'>I'm going to give you another insight now.</segment>
	    <segment id='582' features='semantic-density;sd+'>that is apart from the Locks we have also Tags.</segment>
	    <segment id='583' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Tags are this is for every resource okay Locks can be applied to virtual machines, to services whatever okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='584' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, you can lock any any service and in the same way you can tag any resource that you want.</segment>
	    <segment id='585' features='semantic-density;sd--'>For example, I can put here this is a key value pair so I can put whatever I want here.</segment>
	    <segment id='586' features='semantic-density;sd--'>For example, I can put here thesis experiment, I put here experiment 01 Okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='587' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So now I apply and if I go to the tag, now this network interface has this tag okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='588' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Why is useful the tags?</segment>
	    <segment id='589' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Because imagine that you have developed, deployed sorry, a lot of features, I can navigate through tags, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='590' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And I say for example, "show me everything that is tagged with with thesis experiment number one",.</segment>
	    <segment id='591' features='semantic-density;sd--'>so I can see all the resources related with this experiment.</segment>
	    <segment id='592' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Imagine that you finish with this experiment and you want to remove all the resources.</segment>
	    <segment id='593' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So it's as easy as click on the tab.</segment>
	    <segment id='594' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And you see here all the resources.</segment>
	    <segment id='595' features='semantic-density;sd--'>I can select all and then I will be able either to remove to abate then etc etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='596' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, I am going to explain you Tags right now but it will just to gain some time.</segment>
	    <segment id='597' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, let me check if my network interface that was locked.</segment>
	    <segment id='598' features='semantic-density;sd-'>I remember you that I assigned here one lock, okay, and try to remove this network interface okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='599' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Yes and this is what happened: you receive a message saying "this scope is locked" okay and it tells you "remove a lock if you want and try again".</segment>
	    <segment id='600' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Then I can try to see what locks, I see, I go to the resource and I review the locks that this resource has.</segment>
	    <segment id='601' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And I come here and I say okay, there is one load that said "not remove because it is internet nick" and I say okay, then I prevent to remove that.</segment>
	    <segment id='602' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, so, going back to the presentation, these are Locks these are the Tags, okay, I just tell you what tasks are and also a quick walkthrough.</segment>
	    <segment id='603' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, we have seen security groups Locks, Tags.</segment>
	    <segment id='604' features='semantic-density;sd--'>You see that there is there are a lot of features to protect our resources.</segment>
	    <segment id='605' features='semantic-density;sd+'>As soon as you get more and more controls with Locks, Tags, etc, things get more complicated, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='606' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So the solution are the policies.</segment>
	    <segment id='607' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Policies at the end are a group of different rules that you want to apply to a specific resources.</segment>
	    <segment id='608' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So you can define a specific police for example, who can access, what things can be removed with locks, the tags that you want to apply, etc, etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='609' features='semantic-density;sd-'>You define that in a policy and then you apply the policy to all of your resources, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='610' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So in that way, it is faster to to apply all these features that you want to apply to your resources.</segment>
	    <segment id='611' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Every time that you want to create a new resource, if that resource does not meet the the policy, you will get an alert message.</segment>
	    <segment id='612' features='semantic-density;sd-'>It was the message that I received when I tried to create a virtual machine just before.</segment>
	    <segment id='613' features='semantic-density;sd-'>I have created a policy just to try.</segment>
	    <segment id='614' features='semantic-density;sd--'>saying that I cannot create resources outside Europe, for example.</segment>
	    <segment id='615' features='semantic-density;sd-'>In your policy, you can indicate that your resources must be deployed within Europe.</segment>
	    <segment id='616' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So you remember when we deploy a new virtual machine, we can select the region that where we want to deploy the virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='617' features='semantic-density;sd+'>If the policy of my company says that that resource must be deployed within Europe and I tried to deploy the resource in Asia, I will receive a message and I won't be able to deploy the new virtual machine.</segment>
	    <segment id='618' features='semantic-density;sd-'>There is a higher level of abstraction here that are the blueprint, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='619' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Blueprints are the mix of different policies, different rules, and different manager templates.</segment>
	    <segment id='620' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So it's in a higher level that you want to replicate your company policies in different ambits, okay, in a higher level.</segment>
	    <segment id='621' features='semantic-density;sd+'>At the end, the idea of follow this is try to standardize how the security supplied in every single instance of a resource that you deploy within the cloud, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='622' features='semantic-density;sd-'>In brief, what you need to take into account when, when try to move services to cloud and you want to do that in a secure and proper way?</segment>
	    <segment id='623' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Well, first, you need to define a strategy.</segment>
	    <segment id='624' features='semantic-density;sd--'>This is more or less the framework that Microsoft recommends to follow.</segment>
	    <segment id='625' features='semantic-density;sd--'>First, define a strategy.</segment>
	    <segment id='626' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Second, create a plan.</segment>
	    <segment id='627' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Third, third, be sure that you are ready to move all the resources to cloud with previous tests, etcetera, etcetera.</segment>
	    <segment id='628' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And then do you need in in, let's say, a long lifecycle to control that everything in your in your deployment is done following the policies that you have defined in your previous plan.</segment>
	    <segment id='629' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Okay, so this is more or less in brief, how you must do that.</segment>
	    <segment id='630' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And previously I have told you what are the tools that Azure provide you in order to help you to, to complete this assessment.</segment>
	    <segment id='631' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Okay, finally, regarding privacy laws and data protection that maybe,.</segment>
	    <segment id='632' features='semantic-density;sd-'>maybe you think that you are so far that what, if you are participating in a European research project, you know that from horizon Europe, in the requirements of the data protection, the horizon Europe requires that every project has a data protection plans.</segment>
	    <segment id='633' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So if you deploy the service that you need for that research project within a service like Azure, then you will be in in a good position to complete your data protection plan, because you have a lot of previous services that have been done by Microsoft.</segment>
	    <segment id='634' features='semantic-density;sd+'>For example, Microsoft Azure Cloud has been a Secured by Design all as you can see, there are many, many, many solution features that you want, that you can apply.</segment>
	    <segment id='635' features='semantic-density;sd+'>Second, regarding privacy, Microsoft, provides you a lot of proofs that privacy is taking into account in a cloud deployment, either by a contract by SLAs, etc, etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='636' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And finally, regarding the compliance for every region that Jesús told you days ago, Microsoft respects all the laws that applies to the deployments that you are doing in those regions.</segment>
	    <segment id='637' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So you can be sure that if you deploy one service in a European region, you are meeting the European laws, okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='638' features='semantic-density;sd+'>For example, regarding European laws, there is the famous or infamous article 29 of the EU working party saying that, or stating how data must be managed, okay, so if you deploy your servers in a region within Europe, you can be sure that all data is managed following, this kind of clauses, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='639' features='semantic-density;sd--'>The same for the States and any other, any other law, laws and regulations that can apply.</segment>
	    <segment id='640' features='semantic-density;sd--'>I don't want to extend many here, because it's not so.</segment>
	    <segment id='641' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So technical.</segment>
	    <segment id='642' features='semantic-density;sd+'>You can also create privacy statement regarding how data is managed within the cloud, okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='643' features='semantic-density;sd-'>And also, you can sign for a specific data protection addenda okay.</segment>
	    <segment id='644' features='semantic-density;sd-'>Finally, you can see that security in cloud is quite complex,.</segment>
	    <segment id='645' features='semantic-density;sd--'>there are a lot of things to take into account.</segment>
	    <segment id='646' features='semantic-density;sd--'>And also there are many things to consider.</segment>
	    <segment id='647' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So there is a specific Microsoft central point that is called the Trust Center, where you can get expert information, recommendation, recommendation especifically designed to apply security controls within a cloud deployment.</segment>
	    <segment id='648' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So I encourage you in case that you in the future, you make a huge deployment within the cloud, I recommend you to explore the Microsoft Trust Center, as well as the different compliance documentation that Microsoft can provide you in order for you to prove that your deployment meets the different laws.</segment>
	    <segment id='649' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Finally, you know that there are specific regions of the world that have some restricted laws.</segment>
	    <segment id='650' features='semantic-density;sd+'>I just chose bigger samples that in order to to show that Azure is able to meet any kind of restriction, there is a specific slice or a specific part of Azure that is devoted to deploy United States government services.</segment>
	    <segment id='651' features='semantic-density;sd+'>It has been tested following different standards and a there are federal and local services that are being deployed in Azure cloud.</segment>
	    <segment id='652' features='semantic-density;sd-'>thanks to these kind of a separate regions that are not shared with any other user just in this case for the US government.</segment>
	    <segment id='653' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So they are sure that data is not accessed from any other entities and the same applies for example for China.</segment>
	    <segment id='654' features='semantic-density;sd+'>You know that if you want to give services in China you need to follow specific rules relating with the owner of data, data grant access, audit etc.</segment>
	    <segment id='655' features='semantic-density;sd--'>So in this case, there is a specific agreement between Microsoft and Chinese company that is 21Vianet.</segment>
	    <segment id='656' features='semantic-density;sd+'>So, you can even deploy your cloud services at China regional data centre, okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='657' features='semantic-density;sd--'>I recommend you to follow these three walkthrough.</segment>
	    <segment id='658' features='semantic-density;sd--'>They are more theoretical than practical.</segment>
	    <segment id='659' features='semantic-density;sd--'>Two of them I have already showed you before.</segment>
	    <segment id='660' features='semantic-density;sd+'>One it's how to manage Locks and how to implement Tags.</segment>
	    <segment id='661' features='semantic-density;sd--'>okay, you have just seen an example.</segment>
	    <segment id='662' features='semantic-density;sd+'>And the final it's a more complex walkthrough that is how to create an Azure policy, including network resource groups, sorry, network security groups, rules, laws, etcetera, etcetera.</segment>
	    <segment id='663' features='semantic-density;sd--'>You can find the walkthrough in the in the same link that I have pasted in the chat, okay?</segment>
	    <segment id='664' features='semantic-density;sd-'>So, in this module that I went very fast because as you see it's so theoretical  and maybe for you it's not that interesting.</segment>
	    <segment id='665' features='semantic-density;sd+'>so we have seen different identity features and services, how to control the life circle of the resources and finally how to meet the different rules, standards and regulations of its area. In all of my slides, that you have already uploaded to Teams group, you have the learn path that you should follow if you decide to go through the certification exam, okay? So, my recommendation is that you take enough time, you read all the learn paths and you will be in a good position to complete the certification that as I said before, we will inform you in some days how to complete that. Okay, so, any doubt, any question?</segment>
