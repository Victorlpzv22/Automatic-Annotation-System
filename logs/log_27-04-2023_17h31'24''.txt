sd+       sd-       So, we are we are going to start talking about the Raspberry Pi,
sd+       sd-       and some additional topics about what is an embedded system
sd--      sd-       So, the idea of the British government was to launch something like a very cheap platform to help young people even in the in the lower levels of the schools to develop programming application okay to develop their stem the typical abilities and skills in Mathematics, Physics and these kinds of things.
sd--      sd-       So, they just started going on this platform with the idea of in principle to use this only in the British schools, but, quickly the platform started to develop a very of course, it's very cheap solution.
sd++      sd+       in the development of embedded application electronic software solution using the Raspberry Pi, okay.
sd--      sd-       If you have a look to the to the slide, you will see how at the beginning of the project, they immediately started to to sell a lot of products, and when there goes approximately the number of units that the red Raspberry Pi, the foundation of the Raspberry Pi has produced it sold is around 40 million.
sd--      sd-       It's quite important also to know that finally, I think two years or three years ago, they decided to move to move the production of Raspberry Pi to Wales okay, and this is something that is generating an interesting technological area in this part of the of the British, of the British country.
sd++      sd+       B or even more electronic and embedded systems solutions oriented like the Raspberry Pi computer module or the Raspberry Pi Zero, okay.
sd-       sd+       This is the version that we have here and is more or less all the hardware is more or less quite similar in terms of performance in terms of peripherals, in terms of possibilities, okay.
sd-       sd+       The only difference is is the final performance of the processor,
sd+       sd-       the amount of DDR memory that you have available
sd--      sd-       and these kind of things, but the idea of the platform is more or less the same for all the different versions, okay.
sd--      sd-       Which are the main elements that we have in this platform?
sd+       sd-       the manufacturer called system on chip
sd--      sd-       but there's something that Broadcom is not giving information to the developers of how to use this data centre processors unless that you contact with them and sign an agreement to develop solutions.
sd++      sd+       Broadcom provide also a DDR memory one gigabyte or even two gigabytes of DDR memory to store the typical data and code
sd+       sd-       for for your applications in the operating system solution or departmental solution.
sd++      sd+       This is a different chip that is connected in the PCB of this electronic system.
sd-       sd+       We will use that in our lab okay to connect peripherals and connect sensors to implement application, okay.
sd-       sd+       All these elements are available in this platform that I showed you before okay, this platform the Raspberry Pi three model b plus, okay.
sd+       sd-       This system on chip, okay.
sd+       sd++      And additionally, we have this GPU is a graphical processing unit that is able to run different libraries or binaries that are provided also by Broadcom to accelerate typical video applications.
sd--      sd-       This is not open source, okay?
sd+       sd++      And the chip that is provided in the this Ethernet connectivity is also giving you the USB connectivity, okay.
sd+       sd++      So we have plenty of USB ports to connect keyboards, to connect the mouse or to connect other USB printers.
sd-       sd+       Be careful with this, because if you connect any specific USB or five volts and you are not providing enough current,
sd-       sd+       you will see in the bot a lot of messages messages, giving you feedback about the power supply is not stable, you need to give, you need to provide a good power supplier of five volts or with at least two ampers or something like that, something similar, to get a Raspberry Pi running at the maximum performance.
sd-       sd++      And additionally, we have different interfaces to connect a display, high resolution displays, or to connect your typical monitor screens to display your high high resolution graphics, okay.
sd--      sd-       So it's a computer in a very simple and a smaller form factor, very cheap for the development of application.
sd--      sd+       More things that we have available, we have the option to use a very old interface to connect a video output.
sd--      sd-       Of course, we have here an audio connection,
sd-       sd+       the use of an SD card that's crucial for us
sd+       sd-       because here we are going to provide the operating system and the programs to to develop our solutions
sd+       sd++      We are going to connect here the accelerometer and the color sensor and we are going to connect here interface and USB to to the serial line interface
sd-       sd+       to connect these to a computer to see how the system is configured and to run programs and applications, and other things that are available to connect order peripherals.
sd-       sd++      And this is something that will be very familiar for you because you will be connecting the different cables to interface the accelerometer and color sensor, okay.
sd+       sd-       So here's my computer or if you want a very powerful microcontroller, if we want to call this microcontroller.
sd+       sd++      But from the point of view of that we have there the peripherals we have the CPU, in principle is a very powerful microcontroller, okay.
sd+       sd-       Typically 99% of applications are going to use an operating system,
sd++      sd+       this operating system typically is Linux and embedded Linux solution, okay?
sd+       sd-       We have the option of use the Linus provided by the Raspberry Pi foundation,
sd+       sd++      You don't need a hard disc, you only need an SD card to install the operating system.
sd+       sd-       Typically eight gigabytes is enough.
sd-       sd+       I recommend you that you use a high speed SD card, okay, because the performance of the system depends on the performance SD card.
sd++      sd+       Because this means that we can combine, link and debug programs in the Raspberry Pi.
sd--      sd-       This is not a standard way that we that we typically follow
sd+       sd-       when we are doing application with microcontrollers because we use a computer.
sd++      sd+       We have the debug tools, and what we typically do is to download the code and more or less try to implement a remote debugging of that, okay?
sd-       sd--      So, you can develop your applications there and you can run the application there, okay.
sd+       sd++      Okay, so, you having one SD card, all the tools to deploy IoT applications without the need of use of external computers, okay?
sd+       sd-       So this means I forgot to use operating system
sd--      sd-       I don't want to use a commercial solution or, or open source solution, I prefer to develop my own my own, and no problem, I can program directly with information
sd++      sd+       And we are going mainly programming C and C++, you will see that there are a lot of people programming for the Raspberry Pi using Python.
sd-       sd--      So, this is a first approach of different options to program
sd+       sd-       and to develop application using the Raspberry Pi.
sd--      sd+       Okay, so the main of the course, the name of the course is
sd++      sd+       development of embedded applications, embedded solutions using Raspberry Pi.
sd+       sd-       So now we know what what is a Raspberry Pi.
sd+       sd-       The other concept is, what is an embedded system?
sd+       sd-       Is anybody ready to explain me in one minute, what is an embedded system?
sd+       sd-       Or what's your opinion of what an embedded system is?
sd--      sd-       Try to speak loader, please.
sd++      sd+       So basically, the embedded systems are pieces of code, that are implemented in electronic stuff like, I don't know, TVs or refrigerators
sd+       sd-       but only pieces of code?
sd-       sd+       Not only, hardware
sd-       sd--      And the other message is that it's a specific application.
sd+       sd++      So we are building a specific hardware solution, with a specific software application solving on a specific problem, this is an embedded platform.
sd--      sd-       Okay, something that is doing a specific job that the designer has decidedand of course, you can upgrade application and you can change the XX of course,
sd-       sd+       but this is something is not on mobile phones in the sense that we are changing everyday application and changing everyday the different software solution that we have.
sd+       sd-       So, considering this an embedded system is something that is specialized in doing something special okay.
sd-       sd+       these hardware is connected with an environment because we are measuring different physical variables, temperature, humidity, how our motor is doing things or how different sensors are giving me for measures.
sd+       sd++      It's more of watches, printers, gaming consoles, wireless routers, and in general, all the applications that we see we see today for IoT are in general embedded system oriented applications, okay.
sd-       sd--      And we are going to transmit the information to another computer to make decisions.
sd+       sd++      So we have a microprocessor, an element that is able to execute a bit of a piece of code writing in a specific language that is specified by the manufacturer.
sd+       sd--      We have a program memory and a data memory.
sd++      sd+       Okay, the trend nowadays is that some microcontrollers, some manufacturers like STM is moving to dual core processors.
sd+       sd-       We have different memory blocks, different peripherals.
sd+       sd++      And we use all of these things for the implementation of general purpose application, measure analogue signals, interfaces, these digital elements, etcetera.
sd+       sd-       Typically we implement these using microcontrollers.
sd+       sd-       In our case, we are going to change this by a Raspberry Pi.
sd++      sd+       One of the typical solution in the market is the use of Field Programmable Gateaways and XX devices.
sd+       sd-       Mcroprocessor plus memory plus peripherals.
sd++      sd+       the use of FPGAs or PLDs of high density
sd--      sd-       Okay, they are easy to upgrade, because typically the theme that we are changing is the software of the application okay.
sd+       sd-       Which are the benefit of develop an embedded systems solution?
sd--      sd-       The first one is that we have a good performance, a good efficiency.
sd+       sd-       we will reduce the size of application and we will improve the execution time of the operating system for instance okay.
sd--      sd-       So, in that in that sense is more powerful, the performance is better that if we use more or less a classical solution
sd-       sd--      The option of have more more features in terms of adding more things to the system is something that depends on the solution could be not possible okay.
sd-       sd--      So, adding more functionalities to the system
sd-       sd--      And better dependability.
sd-       sd++      If we think in terms in terms of failure, in the integrity of the system, in an embedded system, this is something that is very very wrong in terms that we have generally hardware that is very well known and the software in general is very simple, okay.
sd-       sd+       okay, considering that the hardware and the software is correctly are correctly designed, okay.
sd+       sd--      control systems, because it's quite easy to measure different physical variables and depending on the values that you get, you can activate different actuator.
sd++      sd-       to develop closed loop control systems.
sd-       sd+       Quite simple to develop applications that are generated under specific sequence of operation because as we are programming, we can decide the condition of our system depending on the different phases of our specific solution.
sd++      sd+       And finally, communication and networking as soon as we have FML and wireless,
sd+       sd++      it's quite easy to get data from external sensors and send information to the to the cloud or to other microcontrollers or to other computers using the Wi Fi or Ethernet or serial lines that we have available in the platform.
sd--      sd-       This is approved generally is very competitive, of course, in the case that we use more or less commercial platforms
sd+       sd-       like the Raspberry Pi,
sd-       sd--      So the weight is not is not a problem in general depending on the application the power could be a problem, but in general
sd++      sd+       this is a low power consumption hardware this is not a desktop computer, this is not a laptop, this is on a small embedded system.
sd-       sd--      Of course, depending on these constraints on your specific application
sd--      sd-       , you have to balance what is the best solution that you have to follow.
sd+       sd-       In the past it was quite common to develop things in Java for a specific solution,
sd++      sd+       but the market now is in C C++ around 90 99 95% of applications are developing C or C++ in C++ in the embedded market.
sd-       sd+       If you have performance issues, you can move to assembly but this is something that is very very strange is not typical.
sd++      sd-       So, in the case of the solution body metal embedded system, typically the parameter application is used for very low low power consumption solutions.
sd+       sd-       But we are going to work with this option: a customize link, an embedded link.
sd+       sd++      So, embedded software?
sd+       sd++      What is embedded software?
sd-       sd+       In principle is a software that is oriented to development to the development of a specific application to control a machine or device.
sd-       sd--      So, we are not consuming a big amount of memory,
sd+       sd-       sometimes this doesn't require an operating system or sometimes depends on the application,
sd-       sd+       So, that's difficult and typically what we try to do is to apply any kind of any kind of abstraction sorry to simplify the software development okay.
sd+       sd-       So, in general, we are going to use the hardware trying to avoid the low level details,
sd++      sd+       when we start using the I2C interface in Linux
sd--      sd-       with a very good level of abstraction Okay, avoiding the use of problems.
sd-       sd+       The responsiveness of the system, okay something that we can control because we don't have very huge number of software layers.
sd+       sd-       So, as soon as we are moving our application very close to the hardware, the triggers can be detected immediately and we can respond in a very agile way reducing the latency of the system.
sd-       sd--      And we can manage different different physical events that are more or less simultaneous
sd+       sd-       using this ability of the operating system.
sd+       sd-       So, the reliability is a problem.
sd-       sd+       we are simplifying their estimation of these values and we are reducing the probability of failure and with that, we are improving the reliability of the system.
sd-       sd--      And the efficiency.
sd-       sd+       Of course, if we are using an SD card instead of a hard disc,
sd++      sd+       if we are using this powerful processor that we have in the RBI where we are managing the different power modes,
sd-       sd--      we are reducing the consumption of energy and of course we are improving the efficiency of the system okay, difficult to see now.
sd-       sd--      when you are developing a specific application.
sd-       sd+       So we have the hardware, we have the software we have tools to develop applications.
sd+       sd++      The interfaces that typically we have in our embedded platform with a microcontroller are specific hardware interfaces provided by the manufacturer.
sd+       sd++      For instance, some of you have experience using the SD microcontrollers and the recently specific interface to interface the debug solution okay.
sd+       sd-       of the solution use in microcontrollers.
sd+       sd++      So, with that, we are going to build more or less than a standard embedded platform with a standard embedded software solution that is the embedded Linux.
sd+       sd++      micro processors or micro processor system base
sd-       sd--      So, for me is quite straightforward to develop applications
sd++      sd+       this complex platform has: here you can see that a dual cord Cortex A processor, okay.
sd++      sd+       Okay, a Cortex air is a specific real time processor is not a Cortex M, you have follow the microprocessor course here at UPM you know and a Cortex M platform, this is a Cortex air solution oriented to real time application.
sd++      sd+       Here we have a very complex logic, XX logic, equivalent to a very powerful API.
sd++      sd-       Subfield devoted to implement algorithms to run neural network.
sd++      sd--      And this is typically they are integrating 60, 64
sd--      sd+       Depends on the on the model of the chip that you that you buy.
sd+       sd++      Okay, so, artificial intelligence cores, audio and video processing engines, programmable hardware to deploy your specific applications.
sd++      sd--      A Cortex solution running and CNCs.
sd+       sd-       So another kind of embedded system solution more oriented to real time real real time applications.
sd-       sd--      Okay, so when you programme all these elements, and you move the information from one site to another site, and you implement very complex solutions.
sd++      sd+       And you can see here that the technology is moving to 40 gigabyte Ethernet connections, 100 gigabyte Ethernet connection, 400 gigabyte Ethernet connections,
sd--      sd-       Okay, we're talking about 1000 euros per component.
sd--      sd-       So it's a very, very interesting platform for the future, because this is something that is available in the market.
sd--      sd-       Something something equivalent from the other manufacturer of these kinds of technologies Intel is providing it's not as complex as the other solution
sd++      sd+       because they are only integrating the BGA part, and the processor part and some high speed technologies interfaces.
sd+       sd++      the first thing that you need to know is how to develop an embedded Linux platform.
sd--      sd-       You'll see the instruction there and you'll see what's this?
sd+       sd-       And in this sense, what software tools are required to implement this bare metal programming?
sd+       sd-       of using bare metal programming versus operating system programming?
sd--      sd-       we are using this because we consider that this is something very flexible 
sd++      sd+       More questions, what are typical what are the typical compiler and leaker that you using a Linux operating system?
sd+       sd-       What are the tools used to compile and link a program?
sd+       sd-       Options, but you have to do this: review the concept of compiler and link
sd+       sd--      What means link?
sd+       sd-       And this different compiler and this differently link.
sd+       sd-       Have you ever used before a library to programme something?
sd+       sd-       In that case in that case which are the extensions that these domes libraries have?
sd+       sd-       What is the purpose of the Linus make command?
sd+       sd-       And in that sense, a make is using a make file, what is a make file?
sd+       sd-       You know all of these concepts are very familiar for you because you have been developing applications for microcontrollers.
sd-       sd--      So, the idea is to more or less to put the information in parallel and we are working with a different solution okay.
sd++      sd+       What means user space and kernel space in Linux?
sd+       sd++      What is a GPU?
sd+       sd--      is developing mining applications to earn money with bitcoins probably yes.
sd+       sd++      Okay, put the image on the SD card and boot the Raspberry Pi.
sd-       sd+       Remember, you need to buy an SD card.
sd+       sd++      Okay, and my recommendation is that at least buy a couple of SD cards because we are going to use one for the Raspbian and the other one for the Raspberry Pi.
sd++      sd+       Sorry for the embedded Linus for the Raspberry Pi.
sd--      sd-       And sometime probably you will need to check that your hardware is working well,
sd++      sd+        and one of the option is to use the Raspbian to boot and verify that your Raspberry Pi's working one.
sd+       sd++      But for the Raspbian, no, I prefer that you use, of course it's much bigger SD card and you need at least eight gigabytes.
sd--      sd-       Okay and the performance is very, very good.
sd-       sd--      Okay, so we have 10 minutes of break and we will do the last presentation today about today
sd+       sd-       about the use of githubs,
sd+       sd-       I encourage you to use the git, okay?
sd-       sd--      Traditionally, you most part of our students typically develop applications, doing different kinds of programming techniques.
sd-       sd+       And people just do a copy on a copy and a copy and a compressed file compressed file and it's is impossible to track the evolution of the code, okay, and it's impossible to solve problems, as soon as you are developing a complex application, okay?
sd-       sd--      So the idea is, is that you try to use an external tool to
sd+       sd-       This is a version control system.
sd-       sd+       That's the idea, avoiding conflicts and avoiding problems, and easy, this is why these collaborative tools are very frequent today in the programming or in general in software, developing techniques.
sd-       sd+       Typically, typically is a scale that is required by companies independently if you are working in software project or in hardware projects, okay?
sd-       sd+       The idea is that we can register the evolution of of the source code in general generally, we are working with code that is written in text files, so, we can verify the syntax and the evolution of the code, okay.
sd-       sd+       The idea is that we can develop my basic application and as soon as I'm progressing in the development of application, I can generate different releases of my software for my clients or for my other users, etc.
sd+       sd-       typically in the industry people is working now with SVM
sd-       sd+       And it's downloading copies of that code to a local repository.
sd--      sd-       Very famous, it's a poor guy, okay, with no money with no resources, but he's the head of the development of all the work related with the Linux XX, okay?
sd-       sd++      Of course, git is open source, and it's available for a lot of platform Windows, Linux, etc Okay.
sd-       sd+       So, in your computer in the Windows the station that you have here you have in this lab, you have the Git client is installed on that Windows okay?
sd+       sd++      I mean the Linux virtual machine, Ubuntu Linux virtual machine that you will be using in the following weeks, the Git will be installed there, okay, you have to install it, okay.
sd+       sd-       So, we are we are going to work with C or C++ for our development
sd--      sd-       and you can have multiple people working in the project developing specific parts of the project and you can in any moment, check a version of the status of the project, compiling the complete project and verify if the project is working or not.
sd+       sd-       I propose you the use of Bitbucket, okay, the free version of Bitbucket is an option,
sd--      sd-       don't worry if you use another one, but the idea is that you create a repository here and you share the repository with my colleague Miguel �?ngel and myself, okay.
sd-       sd--      Again select what tool you prefer to implement the solution.
sd-       sd+       But this is something that is located somewhere, okay, typically, in the cloud, containing the different files of your project.
sd-       sd+       We will have the options to check or to verify the different versions that we have a one file, okay, and you will see how to track the evolution of your code.
sd-       sd+       And typically, depending on the complexity of the project, you can have multiple repositories for your project.
sd+       sd-       Important, we will have something that we call their remote repository.
sd+       sd++      Again, I propose Bitbucket connect to Bitbucket, register an account and create your first repository there.
sd-       sd+       Clone is copy.
sd-       sd+       You we'll be working with this local repository making changes to the code.
sd-       sd+       Changes by changing the code, I compile the code in the code I verify that things are working correctly.
sd++      sd+       For instance, I'm communicating with accelerometer sensor and I've been able to communicate with the sensor and identify the sensor.
sd-       sd--      And I built a very simple program with four functions.
sd++      sd+       I can make a commit a commit to my local repository saying something that
sd-       sd+       Okay, once I'm happy with something that I've completed, locally, in my computer, I have the options to push or to publish that to the global repository or to the remote repository, okay, and make these available in the remote repository.
sd+       sd-       That is something that we call push, okay.
sd+       sd-       And your colleague is developing the communication with a color sensor.
sd+       sd++      If you do the things correctly, you will do a clone to have a local copy, you will implement the color sensor, one of you, the other one, the accelerometer, when some of you make the commit will be saving the changes of the part.
sd+       sd-       And when the other is developing the color sensor will save the changes of that other part.
sd+       sd-       you're trying to push a copy of something
sd--      sd+       So, the first one gaining the repository will do a push and automatically the other colleague
sd+       sd-       when he tries to do the push
sd+       sd-       So please pull to obtain the last version.
sd--      sd-       So, in principle you are not going to have conflict or problem but as soon as we progress in the course, you, a couple will in will be working in parallel in the same problem okay.
sd+       sd-       I want to get a local copy doing doing the clone,and after that we can add local themes.
sd+       sd++      And as soon as the system detects any kind of issue or problem, because you are modifying the same file, or there are any kind of conflict, we will work with something that we will discuss next week about the concept of Git merge and the checkout more additional functionalities that are available in this in the store.
sd+       sd++      My proposal, please use GitHub, sorry, Bitbucket create there a repository, create first create an account to log into the account, create your first repository
sd++      sd+       This is something that means you have super user rights APD installed git tools.
sd+       sd-       Okay, with that you install the commander, there are some graphical versions of the tools.
sd-       sd+       Okay, so forgot to use these graphical versions, I prefer that you use the code, okay.
sd+       sd--      And you can download the local copy to your computer.
sd-       sd--      So with that, the steps are very simple, we create an empty folder.
sd+       sd++      And using the command git add, I'm adding files to the local file to this to the repository.
sd++      sd+       And finally, executing git push we are publishing or making available, the changes to the remote repository.
sd--      sd-       Great. So more or less, four, five commands, to do the basic or to implement the basic steps.
sd--      sd-       with stupid files only with simple test to see the evolution of the things that you are doing.
sd+       sd++      And play with Git add, git commit, git push, git pull and all these command to start understanding the idea.
sd--      sd-       Okay, because this is new, and probably the first time that you play with this is a little bit confusing or difficult to understand.
sd-       sd+       Okay this is a USB Wi Fi that will be used when you are working working here in the lab or at home
sd-       sd+       The idea is to connect to a Wi Fi using this.
sd-       sd+       Okay, so here in the lab we will have a specific Wi Fi access point with no connection to internet, because the only that we are going to do is here 
sd-       sd+       So, take a picture of these, and take these into account and in a Moodle site you have different pictures with the suggested configurations that should be used at home okay.
sd--      sd-       So, what is the purpose of this cable?
sd++      sd+       This is a USB to serial line interface.
sd+       sd++      The first time that you connect the Raspberry Pi to the Wi Fi probably, you'll fail.
sd++      sd-       Because you have an incorrect identification SSID
sd-       sd--      I made the phrases correctly configured.
sd+       sd++      Okay, so that's the purpose of this cable, okay: to connect the USB in my personal computer or in the lab computer to the Raspberry Pi okay?
sd-       sd--      This is the power supply.
sd-       sd--      Please use always this power supply.
sd+       sd-       Okay, and you have the Raspberry Pi with a XX.
sd-       sd--      Okay, I will open a task in Moodle you will have to submit before next class, okay?
sd-       sd--      See youSession 4This is a tool to help us to develop
sd+       sd-       Or control the development of our software application
sd-       sd+       To track the evolution of the code and the other day we were doing we were explaining different simple things about the basic commands about the basic functionalities that we have to manage
sd--      sd-       The basic functions of git OKSo the idea today is to start givingAdditional information thinking on a collaborative use of thisOK what's the goal of thisIn principle you are going to work in couples
sd+       sd-       On the same projectand you are going to add removeAnd make different changes in the codeUsing git okay?
sd-       sd+       So that's the idea of thisI think it's very interesting to Start learning this nowBecause probably at least the students of this school have not experienced using this and it's very complicated if not impossible to control the evolution of the code with folders and versions of the same file it's impossible to maintain and impossible to control it's impossible to fix errors and to give you some feedback
sd+       sd++      OK so the proposal is all of your projects should be managed using git OK for me it's not an issue if you if you want to use instead of Bitbucket GitHub or whatever git in the cloud that you want to use no problem with that the only point is that if you want to share with Miguel Angel and myself the project in order to track the evolution of your code OK?
sd-       sd+       In principle the other day we were talking about how to initialize our repository
sd+       sd++      OK how to download a copy of that repositorything that we didn't define as the clone operation how to do local changes in my files and once that I consider that that code is ready for something
sd++      sd+       and if we want to have the last version of the codethat's available in the remote repository we used the pull command okay?
sd++      sd+       Si I go here, and in clone I get a command that is ILet me one second to create here a folder RPiI'm going to open here a console and I'm going to execute the command git clone okay
sd-       sd+       So now I have here a folder with the code with different files okay?
sd+       sd-       So now if I navigate directly to the report and I update the report
sd-       sd+       So if you use this the advantage you will have is that you can track the evolution of your code
sd+       sd++      OK So, the basicsFrom the report create local changes add local changesPerform a commit of these changes to the local repository with a message push to publish that content in the remote repository okay?
sd-       sd--      So what happens if my colleague is working with a report and wants to have a copy of the last version of the report?
sd-       sd+       So this means that if you are working together on the same project you need to be in phase to avoid problems as we will see later how to solve OK this is the basic things that we are going to use so my expectation our expectation in the first part of the course or at least you manage these commands and then to keep a copy of your project and to follow to track the project okay?
sd+       sd++      And this is the basic view but of course this is yeah this is the getting started of git but git has more has additional functionalities that are very very interesting and the first one is the concept of a branch what means that that means that when we are developing software in one specific point I can say to my colleague please implement this specific functionality read this register from the accelerometer
sd+       sd++      OK my colleague instead of working with the main or the principal or the master branch of the code is going to create another branch a branch is really like a copy that is a pointer to the last version of the code and we are going to assign a specific name to that branch for instance typically devel feature and a name whatever you can imagine but something with some something that is important for you don't put a useless name because it's quite difficult to track the thing okay?
sd-       sd+       In principle if you are developing one thing and your colleague is developing another thing when you perform the merge typically there are no problems or issues and the point here is that two developers are doing the same thing in that case we have the typical thing that we call conflicts
sd+       sd-       You use this idea of branches to more or less organise the development of the codeAre you understanding me yeah?
sd+       sd++      OK and at this point we have two branches of the code as soon as we move to the local repo and we execute the command git fetch which means something to search for changes in the remote repo this is going to discover that there is a new branch that is called devel okay?
sd+       sd++      I can save that to the local stash I can create a commit with a new function OK and I can push this to the remote repository to the branch devel okay?
sd+       sd-       I don't have here the changes because the changes are in the branch that we have called colleague devel, okay?
sd+       sd++      devel typically is where we are developing thingsand main is always like the release version of the code the final product that we are going to have OK so with this organization you can create an intelligent evolution of the code ways to create branches and to change from one branch to another using the command git check out with that you change the branch that you are using
sd+       sd++      OK and with git status git status you can verify in which branch you are for instance here executing git status we can see that we are in the master branch OK that's the old definition now it's the main branch that means that here we have a new file and the file that we have deleted okay?
sd+       sd-       and files that are in traffic?
sd+       sd++      So the procedure is we change from a specific branch with the command check out OK we put the last changes of that branch with pull we are doing a copy of the remote repo so a local repo OK with that we are discovering the last changes
sd-       sd--      OK and we are doing that changes locally okay?
sd+       sd++      And finally if we want to move some specific content of one branch to another so this means we want to move the changes that we have in the devel branch to the master branch or to the main branch what we execute is this command git merge okay?
sd+       sd++      OK please have a look to that and basically what happens is the following when you execute the merge if everything is correct because there is no conflict you will see something like this you are mixing the code no problem what happens if there is an error?
sd-       sd+       In that case you see a message saying you that there are conflicts and you need to solve that conflict OK so that means that you have to compare files and select which is the appropriate code which you want finally maintain
sd+       sd++      OK imagine that he defines the variable A and you define the variable B you put that in the same line of code and the problem is you have to decide if you want variable A or variable B it's as simple as that typical tools to resolve conflicts I recommend that when you are working in Linux you use Mel Mel is a very interesting tool to compare source files
sd+       sd-       OK you can see on the screen the source files and you can compare line by line the content of the file and you can move things from one file to another
sd-       sd+       with the different files in order to select what is the final code that you want to have and you can move things from one file to another okay?
sd-       sd+       Please have a look to the slides to understand this correctly I recommend you this address OK to download these graphical representations of the meaning of the different commands
sd--      sd-       don't put version one version two version three that has no sense this is a version that is reading the registers and is working or is not working and it is not working because there is this problem something that is meaningful for the reviewer or your classmate or for you OK so try to organize your development in different characteristics or features
sd+       sd-       OK and with that you will avoid problems in the future and push to master only a stable version
sd+       sd++      This is a quite quick guide with the commands clone checkout merge pull push you need to be familiar with this in the first part of the course
sd-       sd+       OK basic development and if you are doing things typically you are using these commands and the only problem can be here when you are trying to solve conflicts
sd--      sd-       OK because probably if you don't have previous experience using this or the first time it's a little bit difficult to master questions are you understanding me yes sure sure we will see later
