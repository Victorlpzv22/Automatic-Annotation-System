sd--      sd-       Okay, just in case that someone see the recording after the live event,
sd-       sd+       And now I'm talking about the Azure security Azure Sentinel.
sd+       sd-       because using artificial intelligence solution
sd-       sd+       it also investigate all of these logs, and all of these amount of data in order to get a quick response to new threats that can affect your network.
sd-       sd+       In this case, on Amazon Azure cloud.
sd-       sd+       how to deploy a virtual machine, one of the actions that you perform was
sd+       sd-       to create a symmetric key pair.
sd+       sd++      how to create that key pair in your local computer and then you need to upload the secret key, sorry, the public key to the to the to the Amazon, sorry, to Microsoft Azure platform.
sd-       sd+       Imagine that you have in your company, like let's say 30 virtual machines with a 100 users, and with the 1000 clients connected.
sd-       sd--      You can imagine that you will get a huge amount of keys that you need to manage in a proper way.
sd+       sd-       The Azure Key Vault is nothing and more nothing less than a key wallet,
sd-       sd+       where you can store all the application keys, secrets, credential certificates, etc.
sd-       sd+       And then you can manage then using the groups that you have created in order to get also control of the access and authentication that we will review in some minutes.
sd+       sd++      The Azure Key Vault provide you with solutions to keep control of the secrets of the keys that you generate, also of the certificates that sometimes you need to install in your servers in order to provide security service like HTTPS etc and this is provide you by Microsoft using a specific set of hardware that is called the hardware security modules.
sd+       sd++      Hardware security modules is a,
sd--      sd-       For example, a keys okay or or certificates.
sd-       sd++      If you have on Android or an iOS cell phone, they have both this kind of hardware security modules and all your keys your fingerprints etc., they are stored in the security models.
sd-       sd+       If the operating system of your cell phone is compromised in some ways,
sd-       sd--      and using high level engineering tools
sd--      sd+       get access to your mobile, in the worst case it will get access to your, let's say, to all your documents, pictures, chats etc.
sd-       sd+       but it's almost impossible to get access to your security credentials, your keys, your fingerprints, etc
sd+       sd-       because they are stored in a specific security model.
sd--      sd-       This is something that is, as I said, is a it's very common nowadays in all electronic devices.
sd++      sd+       And it's also implemented in all the cloud data centers that Microsoft use for for Azure.
sd-       sd--      if you remember, we compared the pros and cons of
sd+       sd-       in Tyre two level, in layer two levels okay?
sd--      sd+       So, you cannot get access to another clients machines and data okay.
sd-       sd+       But for some kind of sensitive application or in other in other words, in order to meet a specific laws regarding data storage and data management
sd++      sd+       like genomics or biometric data from users like XXrate or medical records etc.
sd++      sd-       and in Europe, we have the LGPv that is specific well the  GDPR that is a specific data protection regulation
sd+       sd-       One of the requirements could be that you cannot share host with other third entities okay.
sd+       sd++      there is this specific solution that is dedicated host where you can select to deploy, let's say, a virtual machine in a specific host that is not shared within other Azure client,
sd-       sd+       so you can be sure that in that host, only your virtual machine or your services or whatever you want to deploy are running.
sd-       sd+       So it's like a getting your physical server from your data center and go to the Azure Data Center, install the appliance and then you are you are that, okay?
sd-       sd+       It is true that you are not sharing the host, but remember that you are in a public cloud.
sd--      sd-       But this is more than enough to cover almost all the law requirements or all the security requirements when dealing with sensitive data etc.
sd+       sd-       Also regarding scalability and
sd+       sd-       if it is deployed in a dedicated host
sd-       sd--      t will take you more time and is not so easy as when
sd+       sd-       it is deployed in a regular serve host, okay.
sd-       sd+       So, on one hand you have that you are isolated from other clients and on the other hand, you have that is not so flexible
sd-       sd++      But if you remember when when we deploy premises, when we deploy services on Cloud premises, it doesn't matter the model if it was platform as a server infrastructure or or software, there was there was some kind of layers
sd+       sd++      that were managed by the cloud provider in terms of hardware updates, software operating system, etc.
sd-       sd--      So, it was transparent to you.
sd--      sd-       So if you are providing a service to a third party and you have signed with that party and as SLA as Jesús told you yesterday,
sd--      sd+       kay, not in this way or not during Monday Friday or only on Mondays" or whatever okay, because at the end is your own host and you can decide when to update, when to apply maintenance activities.
sd-       sd+       Finally, another good point of these dedicated hosts is that you can also move all your license regarding software etc.
sd-       sd+       Because at that point, a dedicated host is not different from a host that you have on your premises.
sd-       sd+       of the of the security services that you can use inside Azure platform.
sd+       sd-       Let's focus now on how to protect the network connectivity.
sd++      sd+       We are going to see the different layers of defense in times of network security.
sd+       sd-       We are going we are going to review also what is or what are the network security sorry the network security groups.
sd+       sd-       We are doing here also our walkthrough and a practical assessment regarding network security groups.
sd++      sd+       And then we are going to see also on other options that you can use inside Azure platform that are the firewall and the DDoS protection.
sd+       sd-       Okay, so if you think in how to protect data from unauthorized access,
sd-       sd+       If you protect a these six layers before getting access to data, then you will be in a in a good position to assure that your data is not compromised, but any any kind of attack okay.
sd-       sd+       So, the very first, if we start from outside the perimeter to inside data, so, this is the core that we want to protect and these are the boundaries of our hardware platform.
sd-       sd+       So, it will start from outside to inside the first one that we have is the physical security layer.
sd-       sd++      The physical security layer is the very first access point to the to the hardware platform okay.
sd-       sd++      So, in that case, the what the cloud provider does is to be sure that no no one can access your the hardware your your your service or our deploy okay and also is the first a safe one to your to that to the next to the next layer okay.
sd-       sd+       In that way here we must focus to control access to the infrastructure and also to keep track of any any change that happened in the infrastructure.
sd++      sd-       Also is very common to use single sign on multi factor authentication
sd-       sd+       and also as I commented before, to a keep track of any event and change that happen within the the access and the identity of person or people accessing the machine.
sd-       sd+       The first layer is the perimeter in this case we are talking about inside and outside the network boundaries of our our systems, okay.
sd+       sd-       between the the what they call the MZ, the the military zone
sd-       sd+       In this case, the idea is to protect the network from external attacks, okay.
sd-       sd+       The fourth layer is the is the network.
sd-       sd--      Also to restrict any traffic coming from the Internet unless that it is allowed.
sd+       sd--      So here what Microsoft ablaze applies is the politic of "denied by default",
sd-       sd+       so everything is closed, everything is denied, no connection can be performed from outside from the Internet to our network, and we decide to to open.
sd-       sd+       Here, it is important to protect the access to the all the virtual machines.
sd+       sd-       For example, that we'll have deployed and also to implement endpoint protection to the to the device.
sd+       sd-       Here the the main tools is to check if the virtual machine are updated, if they are some malware running inside it, etc, etc.
sd-       sd--      Here when we expose one application to the Internet, we need to be sure that the application are secure and are free of vulnerabilities.
sd--      sd-       We need also to keep a the all the secrets, all the keys, all the certificates related to a specific application,
sd+       sd-       in our a secure storage solution as the one that I have presented before with the HSM.
sd-       sd--      And finally, we must be we must assure that all the application development that we perform follows a secure design as a good design.
sd--      sd-       Finally, the data, this is, this is, let's say the the bounty when when someone attacks your your system, this is what they are looking for, is data.
sd--      sd-       Today 90% of of attacks go go against the data, okay?
sd-       sd+       So there was some time ago that they the normal attacks were the kinds of denial of service, okay, so the idea was to stop the the proper function of your servers
sd+       sd-       to get your servers down.
sd--      sd-       That that was the the main target of attackers, okay.
sd--      sd-       They they look for your data, not only to stole data, and then try to get some money with that data, you can think about credit card numbers, personal identification numbers, etc, etc.
sd+       sd-       But also the buzzword now in in these kinds of attacks are the ransomware attacks, that maybe you have heard about.
sd-       sd+       These kinds of attacks going your systems, look for your data and using various strong key, encrypt all your data and then ask you for money to provide you the key in order for you to restore access to your data.
sd-       sd+       So here we need to protect data that is stored in databases, in hard discs, in virtual discs, that we are using in virtual machines.
sd--      sd-       All the data that is stored in that application that we use in as software as a service, for example, the the office, a software application that you use, thanks to the agreement between UPM and Microsoft, when you are editing online documents, all of this data about the author, data itself I mean text that you are writing, etc.
sd-       sd--      So you need to protect to protect them also, okay.
sd-       sd+       So more or less, these are all the all the layers that you need to protect when you want to be sure that all the cloud deployments are are secure.
sd-       sd--      And sometimes you need to show how secure your application are.
sd--      sd+       Because, your applications are, because maybe your clients or maybe the governments asked you for an audit
sd-       sd--      in order to show how secure your systems are.
sd--      sd-       Okay, so who is the responsible of any of these of any one of these layers?
sd-       sd+       If you remember, we were moving from local from local deployments, where all the layers were, were being provided in our premises.
sd-       sd+       And of course, we were responsible of all the layers, okay, from hardware to application and data, okay.
sd+       sd-       And then we have the three cloud models:
sd+       sd++      When we are using infrastructure as a service, the cloud provider manages all the tools, all the all the issues related with the hardware platform, so it involves networking Security, perimeter control, firewalls, etc etc.
sd+       sd-       And we were assigned to control security from virtual machine and above, okay.
sd+       sd++      If we use platform as a service where we just deploy our own application, then the cloud provider manage almost all the layers set the application and data.
sd+       sd++      So, you you can see in this picture that if we move through from the first scenario that we that was having all them all the deployment on our premises, we were responsible of assuring the security in your layers, and the on the other hand, if we are using software as a service,
sd+       sd-       what are the client endpoints,
sd-       sd+       that is from where they are connecting, and finally, how we manage data;   if users can store data on cloud or they need to store data locally, etc, etc.
sd+       sd-       So, we are going to review afterwards the different way to control access
sd-       sd+       So as I said before, there are different services that you can use inside the platform to protect specific layers of your deployments.
sd+       sd-       The first one is the network security groups,
sd-       sd+       So we can protect who can access to our cloud resources and also we can decide what can our resources access outside the cloud platform.
sd-       sd+       For example, we can limit that some of our virtual machine can access Internet or not okay.
sd-       sd+       So we can decide that for a specific group of virtual machines maybe they can be accesses outside internet
sd+       sd++      but they cannot get outside the cloud network connection in order to avoid software download etc etc.
sd+       sd--      So we can we can apply here rules in order to to set the environment about traffics, we can also add specific rules related with our subcription limits.
sd-       sd--      We can also use what we are going to review afterwards that is a specific policies
sd+       sd++      or  specific what Azure calls blueprints that are specific network configuration in order to deploy our virtual machine etcetera in a faster way okay.
sd--      sd-       We can also apply different rules and we can assign different priority to the rules.
sd-       sd+       So, the the traffic is evaluated following the same priority as we define and depending on that we can we can decide what what to what action must be performed.
sd-       sd+       This is not very different to what a firewall is, I don't know if you are familiar, if you are familiar with firewall configuration, this is more or less what a firewall, how a firewall is configured.
sd+       sd++      Indeed we have a specific cloud firewall solution within the Azure platform, that is something that they call a firewall as a service.
sd--      sd+       in order to decide which kind of content can be served to the clients, how we can control the clients connection etc etc.
sd-       sd+       So, it doesn't matter the data, doesn't matter the the application that you are deploying on cloud that you will find out a specific solution.
sd--      sd+       So you even notice that these kind of attacks are being performed against your your network.
sd-       sd+       So, in brief, in order to protect all the all the layers, and to and to warranty that our data is safe, we need to combine different different solutions, all of them provided by by the by the platform.
sd-       sd++      We have firewalls, we have network security groups, we have a perimeter controls in order to protect our network against denial of service attacks and using the network security groups, we can also define which kind of traffic are what kind of traffic is allowed within and externally to our to our network.
sd-       sd++      We are going to create a network security group and we are going to define one rule that is to allow remote desktop connection to that sorry to that virtual machine Okay.
sd-       sd+       In that way we can check that our virtual machine is visible from outside and then we are going to define another rule in order to limit the access to the internet that the virtual machine has.
sd-       sd+       Okay, sometimes it's very useful to forbid the virtual machines to get access to internet, okay, because you want to protect what you can do within this virtual machines.
sd-       sd--      I'm going to follow one of the walkthroughs provided by by Microsoft, let me paste here to walkthrough the link, okay.
sd--      sd-       And if you find any trouble, or if you, if any action that I'm performing is not clear for you while I'm doing that action, just stop me and I can, and I can explain you what what I'm doing,
sd-       sd--      I'm going to paste in the chat, the the walkthrough link
sd--      sd-       this one, okay, so you can get a access to the to the walkthough and you should see that is walkthrough number 13.
sd-       sd--      So first, we are going to create
sd+       sd++      a virtual machine, then we're going to create a network security group, we're going to assign that virtual machine to the network security group, we are going to allow remote desktop protocol connection from outside to our virtual machine, we're going to check and then we are going to disallow Internet connection from our virtual machine.
sd-       sd+       is to go to our Microsoft Azure portal, okay.
sd-       sd--      So I give you just one minute to
sd-       sd++      to connect to your Azure portal account.
sd--      sd-       And you should get a similar picture as I have here.
sd-       sd+       of the cloud of the Azure cloud system
sd--      sd-       I'm just making time for you to connect.
sd-       sd+       you have the code in Python in local in your own machine, but you want to, to keep this code running
sd+       sd-       You select Python, then you decide what framework, Okay, let's say Python.
sd--      sd+       Okay, this is just something for you to know, if you want to deploy in a very, very fast way, your own code
sd-       sd+       and leave the code running here on Cloud.
sd-       sd--      Talking about resources is to create a specific resource group.
sd-       sd+       Well, virtual machine name, it's a simple virtual machine, simple virtual machine 21, because I have another one called IDs.
sd-       sd++      Image we are going to deploy here the Windows Server Data Center, okay, you have a lot of images to deploy in your virtual machine.
sd+       sd-       Okay, size, well you can decide here the decide...In the walkthrough, they recommend you to use the DS d2s, v2 v3. Okay.
sd+       sd++      Indeed it's powerful is eight gigabyte RAM with two virtual CPUs and 16 gigabytes okay?
sd--      sd-       Well, we need to select on username for the administrators let's say, Azure user that is what they recommend just to follow the walkthrough, but you can select whatever.
sd--      sd-       Well the password, you can use whatever you want, but remember that it needs to be it need to have at least numbers, capital letters and special symbol Okay, okay.
sd--      sd-       This is important because this is what we are going to do but instead of allowing Azure to create these
sd+       sd-       how to open this port in an automate way,
sd+       sd-       and then we can move to the Network tab.
sd--      sd-       Okay, this is okay, network.
sd-       sd--      Okay, so we need to click known because we are going to sell it afterwards our own security group.
sd+       sd-       Okay, if we move to management we need to disable the diagnostic that the router machine performs when rebooting.
sd-       sd--      Okay, so we disable and that's all.
sd--      sd-       Well, it takes some time to apply the policy so let me check.
sd+       sd-       now the walkthrough, boot disable.
sd--      sd-       Let me check if the policy has been applied or not.
sd-       sd--      So you can just write here "network security group" okay.
sd-       sd+       It doesn't matter if your virtual machine is still being created, you can jump to the network security group.
sd-       sd--      Okay, so, and here, let's add a new security group.
sd--      sd-       Here we need to select a subscription.
sd-       sd--      Now, we only have one and a resource group.
sd+       sd-       I'm going to use and this is for, let's say, virtual machines, RDB.
sd--      sd-       Well, for me is the same, they are asking me for the policy, this is still ongoing, I'm going to go through that afterwards.
sd-       sd--      But when talking about security policies,
sd--      sd-       it takes some time the policy to apply, it can, it can get up to half an hour, I have experimented on times when I don't know if
sd--      sd-       So for you, this error won't be here on you should create the resource, okay, no problem, I have one resource already created here.
sd--      sd-       Okay, so, let me I'm going to delete this one just to... let me check what network.
sd-       sd+       And then what we are going to do is that we are going to assign this security group that we have just created to the network interface that our virtual machine has, okay, how we know the name of the virtual machine?
sd-       sd+       So we have created the the network security group we only need to configure let's go back and check if our virtual machine has been created.
sd--      sd-       So if someone put in the chat if your virtual machine has been created I go ahead if not I can wait.
sd-       sd+       Okay, so we have the virtual machine created with all the features, let's go to networking, in settings to networking.
sd--      sd-       Okay, so for me is the name of the virtual machine and three numbers okay?
sd--      sd-       For you, the format should be the same.
sd-       sd+       The security group, we have already created our network security group and then we need to assign this security group to our virtual machine network interface.
sd--      sd-       So we come here and let me I'm going to... you don't have this this network here because you need to introduce.
sd-       sd+       but for your case, if you paste here, the name of your virtual machine or you just on roll this box, you will find the associate network for your virtual machine.
sd-       sd+       Okay, so you select the the network, okay, you click here in okay and then you will find that your virtual machine network interface has been associated to that security group.
sd-       sd+       So, every action that we take now to this security group will affect to all the associated network interface here.
sd-       sd+       Imagine that you have 10 virtual machines that you want to control or that you want to get access using remote desktop that is the example that we are going to perform today.
sd-       sd+       So, the only thing that you need to do is assign all the network interfaces of your virtual machine here the 10 virtual machine network interfaces and then you only need to perform one action in the in your security group that will affect to all the virtual machine.
sd+       sd-       You have inbound security rules outbound security rules, network interface you can create subnets etc etc.
sd-       sd+       I have one rule created but I can even remove here but let's keep it and let's try to access to our virtual machine using remote desktop from our local machine.
sd--      sd-       Let's go back to our virtual machine.
sd--      sd-       So this is a virtual machine I have just created.
sd-       sd--      Probably if you have just created the machine is up and running for you.
sd+       sd-       And the only thing that you need to do now is clicking in connect and selecting a RDP.
sd--      sd-       Give me a minute for my virtual machine to start please.
sd--      sd-       So let me check if my virtual machine...
sd++      sd+       Okay, you should be able to see here a dialog where you can select the RDP protocol that is the remote desktop protocol.
sd--      sd-       Let me check what is happening with my virtual machine.
sd+       sd-       Okay, it's started, connect, RDP okay.
sd--      sd-       And if I open that file,
sd+       sd-       it gets contact with my RDP client
sd--      sd-       and I can click in Connect.
sd-       sd++      If you click now in Connect, you will receive an error message saying that you cannot reach that virtual machine because if you remember there is no open ports in that virtual machine so we cannot reach.
sd-       sd+       Forget about the virtual machine and get back to the network security Group and let's define that for the network security group that we have just created, we can we want to open a new inbound rule.
sd-       sd--      Inbound that is this one of here.
sd--      sd+       I have login.
sd-       sd+       So, source whatever you can limit for example, we can if we open our virtual machine to be connected by any IP it means that anyone of you can connect to any virtual machine that you have created, okay, but we can limit.
sd-       sd+       If you say IP address, if you paste here your machine public IP address, then only your local machine will be allowed to connect but leave it at any because.
sd-       sd--      You can see that there are many services.
sd+       sd++      For example, email, SMTP or IMAP or POP3 related to email LDAP, email, email, DNS and we have here RDP okay?
sd-       sd--      and you want to allow or deny in that case this case we want to allow, okay.
sd--      sd-       So, it gives you here a recommendation saying be careful because if you open then the port will be exposed to the internet or blablabla, okay you click in Add, okay, and then you will see a line like this one.
sd-       sd+       What is priority?
sd+       sd-       Priority means that you can see here that I have one, two, three, four rules applied to my inbound traffic.
sd-       sd+       So every time data packets arrives to my network, to a network interface that is associated to this security group, for each data packet, it will be analysed following these rules.
sd--      sd-       And if the priority is very high, it doesn't matter what you put here, that since the first rule will be applied, all your traffic will be denied, okay?
sd--      sd-       So in the walkthrough, I recommend you to use 300 as a priority.
sd+       sd--      Okay, so if we have created that inbound rule.
sd--      sd++      Okay, Connect.
sd-       sd--      It was "azuruser", if I recall, well, let me check.
sd--      sd-       Yes, "azuruser" and the password that you created, okay.
sd-       sd+       And then we will get access to our virtual machine.
sd-       sd+       This is the virtual machine that is running in cloud
sd-       sd+       So please open the web browser and tell me if you're, if your virtual machine has internet access or not, you can click for example, Google, or whatever, whatever you want.
sd--      sd-       Okay, and tell me on chat if you have internet access or not.
sd--      sd+       Or if you have any trouble connecting the virtual machines, you can also tell me okay.
sd-       sd+       So do you have Internet access from the web browser?
sd-       sd+       Is your virtual machine able to connect to Internet?
sd--      sd-       So you have access to the Internet.
sd-       sd+       So imagine that now, we want to disallow this virtual machine to access to the Internet.
sd-       sd+       We have opened, we have created a rule to allow inbound traffic to get to our virtual machine and thanks to that, we have been able to connect to our virtual machine.
sd-       sd+       So let's try to limit the Internet connection of our virtual machine.
sd-       sd+       Once again, if we go to our security group since the network interface of my of our virtual machine is assigned to the security group, every rule that we apply here will be apply to all the virtual machines that we have already associated.
sd-       sd+       Well, you click in Add, okay, and going to do it with you, then you can go through Source and if you go to Source, you can again limit the IP addresses that you want to to limit, in this case, it doesn't matter any, you want to limit all the Internet connection.
sd--      sd-       So Ports, the same.
sd-       sd--      Here Destination, we need to define what we want to limit.
sd-       sd+       We want to limit our virtual machine to connect to the Internet, okay?
sd--      sd-       Internet is everything outside our network.
sd-       sd+       It's quite difficult to define this in IP addresses.
sd+       sd-       And in the same way we have a Service Tag that is called Internet okay.
sd+       sd-       Here in the in thein Service, you can select for example HTTP so you are limiting a only Port-80.
sd-       sd--      Or you can select.
sd+       sd++      So we are limiting every HTTP or HTTPS or whatever other connection.
sd--      sd-       Priority the same as I told you now, the lowest the number the highest the priority okay?
sd+       sd--      Okay you click in Add, okay, and it should appear here okay in your outbound security rules.
sd--      sd-       Once that your rule appears here, it is, you can check if it is a deny or allow action, so everything is okay.
sd-       sd+       And then it should happen as me that my virtual machine now has no Internet connection.
sd--      sd-       So we have done for one virtual machine but is the same that I told you before.
sd-       sd+       Imagine that you have a bunch of virtual machines with only one rule, we are limiting all the access to all the virtual machines okay?
sd-       sd+       You have seen also how to access through remote desktop.
sd-       sd--      Okay, remember that every time that the machine is up and running, you are consuming credit.
sd-       sd+       So my recommendation now, you close the Remote Desktop Connection, okay, and then go to the dashboard, go to your virtual machine.
sd+       sd++      Okay, so in brief, we have review, what it what is the issue Security Center, how we can manage keys and how we can manage logs and get a insights of our what is happening in our in our servers in terms of security, what are dedicated hosts, how defence can be applied using different layers on how Azur provides you protection against denial of service attacks.
sd--      sd-       PEDRO- So, I'm going to give you the last presentation of the course
sd--      sd-       If you have any question regarding module four or the walkthrough that we have just perform, you can you can tell me now or otherwise, I will I will start with the module five.
sd-       sd--      And another tools to test the compliance of those laws.
sd++      sd+       So, in brief, we are going to review the different identity services that are available in Azure platform, the different governance features that you can use for your own company and finally, the different privacy solution and compliance agreements that Microsoft has for the Azure platform.
sd+       sd++      And then we are going to review the Active Directory provided in the cloud by Azure, the functionality of these active directory and finally, other access control mechanism like single sign on.
sd+       sd++      So, authentication and authorization, these are two words that maybe you know, but apply it to IT security, it has, they have different different meanings with authentication we control who is accessing any any asset okay.
sd-       sd+       We can do that using access credential, for example, a user name and a password and is the basic feature to start controlling the access to our resources okay.
sd-       sd++      So with authentication, we control who access and with authorization, we control what this person is able to, to do in the in the servers.
sd+       sd++      These are these two services authentication and authorization are the basics to control or to manage the roles that the all the persons in our company or external like clients or users etc are allowed to do in our in our in our services.
sd-       sd--      So, let's see how we can we can provide these two these two services okay with different solutions that that we can use.
sd+       sd-       The first one is the multi factor multi factor authentication.
sd--      sd-       Normally you are you are used to provide username and password.
sd--      sd+       But you provide the username password and if it match with the records that the company has for you then you get access okay.
sd-       sd+       But if you are using some sensitive service like for example, online banking, you know that they are also using a third factor authentication that could be for example, sending you a message to your cell phone and then you provide the code that is included in that message okay.
sd--      sd+       So, in that in that case, you are using not only something that you know, that could be the password, you are providing something that you have, okay, in this case you have your cell phone because normally there's your cell phone, you only have access to it unless that someone have stolen okay.
sd--      sd-       There is another factor for authentication that is a something that you are okay something that you are is is something that you  and only you can provide.
sd--      sd+       So, now we know three different a factors to authenticate who you are: something that you know, for example, the password; something that you have, for example, your cell phone or your your national
sd--      sd-       ID card that is something that that you have okay.
sd-       sd+       So, this is the multi factor and in Azure you can find solutions to provide each one of these different authentication factors.
sd--      sd+       So you can use or you can decide how your clients are connected or your or your members can connect to your to your services, okay.
sd+       sd-       If you are familiar with IT services, probably you know what Active Directory is.
sd+       sd--      Active Directory is so old Microsoft solution to manage identity in corporation, okay.
sd-       sd+       There is a specific deployment of these active directory in cloud that is called Azure Active Directory and that behaves in the same way.
sd-       sd+       So, if in your company, you have an Active Directory already deployed, it's very easy to migrate from the local Active Directory to the to the Azure, okay.
sd--      sd+       In that way you can provide authentication based on that directory you can provide single sign on, that is a specific solution to provide access to different services with only one sign on, okay.
sd--      sd+       So you introduce the password only one time and then you get access to different service etc.
sd--      sd++      You know and now in this pandemic times we have experimented in harder way that we can connect to our company network, on company premises, at home, using mobile devices etc.
sd-       sd+       So, you can even decide depending on where the user is, where the how the user is connecting etc if you want to apply one a authentication factor two three, etc.
sd-       sd+       For example, if you detect that a user is trying to connect to the network with a computer connected using cable to your local area network
sd--      sd++      then you can reviews the number of security measures that you want to apply because you know that he's inside the building so is difficult that someone gets inside etcetera, etcetera, but if you detect for example, that one user is trying to connect from a foreign country, for example, we are in Spain and we detect a connection coming from Russia for example, with a mobile device, then we can start deploying additional controls, because the risks are are higher than in the previous example that I have commented.
sd--      sd+       So, you can detect where the user is what is the device that the user is is trying to connect from, the application that is trying to use etcetera, etcetera, then you can decide the measures, okay.
sd+       sd--      Well, regarding the the governance methodology,
sd+       sd-       The first one is role based controls, okay.
sd+       sd-       So, role based is
sd--      sd+       you know, because you are users of at least of one one organization that the that is UPM and you know that depending on your role, you can have access to some service and you can have access limited to to some others, okay.
sd--      sd-       So, in Azure, you can define different user groups, you can assign user to each kind of group and you can define policies to to define what user is allowed to do, depending on the group that it takes part, okay.
sd-       sd--      This is one control.
sd+       sd-       The other control is the Resource Locks.
sd--      sd+       For example, imagine that you deploy a virtual machine that is critical for your infrastructure.
sd-       sd+       It's a virtual machine that is taking care, for example of your firewall of your company, okay?
sd-       sd+       So, you want to be sure that any of your IT staff remove that virtual machine accidentally okay.
sd+       sd-       So, you can apply Locks.
sd+       sd--      You can go to a specific resource, you select the resource and then you apply Lock.
sd-       sd--      You have two types of Lock, the CanNotDelete Lock and the ReadOnly Lock.
sd--      sd-       You have here the features of these two locks.
sd-       sd+       If you select one virtual machine and you apply a CanNotDelete Lock, then users can read, can access to the virtual machine can update they virtual matching with new features etc.
sd--      sd-       Let me check if the new policy has been applied.
sd--      sd+       And if you remember, before that I get an error message and now the policy is not applied and is being successful.
sd-       sd--      ah no, this is the Lock.
sd-       sd--      Ah let me check, I have the Lock here.
sd-       sd--      this was in this case a security rule that I decide to lock.
sd--      sd-       So, I can go to my let me check a the this one... Locks...  the resource, let me check...  It's not that one...  this is why if you have define different groups is easier to manage.
sd-       sd--      Okay, so I have here let me check if a have any lock... no and here...  yeah...  you see that for every resource I'm navigating, I can check if they have lock or not.
sd-       sd--      So it's as simple as going to lock apply Add Lock, you  just put the name, for example, not remove Internet nick.
sd+       sd--      Remember that we have to lock types Delete or ReadOnly so I select Delete, I apply okay, so now it has one lock.
sd--      sd-       I'm going to wait a little bit.
sd+       sd--      For example, I can put here this is a key value pair so I can put whatever I want here.
sd-       sd+       So now I apply and if I go to the tag, now this network interface has this tag okay.
sd-       sd+       Because imagine that you have developed, deployed sorry, a lot of features, I can navigate through tags, okay.
sd-       sd--      And I say for example, "show me everything that is tagged with with thesis experiment number one",
sd-       sd--      Yes and this is what happened: you receive a message saying "this scope is locked" okay and it tells you "remove a lock if you want and try again".
sd-       sd+       Okay, so, going back to the presentation, these are Locks these are the Tags, okay, I just tell you what tasks are and also a quick walkthrough.
sd-       sd--      So the solution are the policies.
sd-       sd--      Policies at the end are a group of different rules that you want to apply to a specific resources.
sd-       sd+       So you can define a specific police for example, who can access, what things can be removed with locks, the tags that you want to apply, etc, etc.
sd--      sd-       In your policy, you can indicate that your resources must be deployed within Europe.
sd-       sd+       So you remember when we deploy a new virtual machine, we can select the region that where we want to deploy the virtual machine.
sd-       sd+       If the policy of my company says that that resource must be deployed within Europe and I tried to deploy the resource in Asia, I will receive a message and I won't be able to deploy the new virtual machine.
sd--      sd-       There is a higher level of abstraction here that are the blueprint, okay.
sd+       sd-       Blueprints are the mix of different policies, different rules, and different manager templates.
sd+       sd--      So it's in a higher level that you want to replicate your company policies in different ambits, okay, in a higher level.
sd-       sd--      And then do you need in in, let's say, a long lifecycle to control that everything in your in your deployment is done following the policies that you have defined in your previous plan.
sd--      sd-       And previously I have told you what are the tools that Azure provide you in order to help you to, to complete this assessment.
sd--      sd+       So if you deploy the service that you need for that research project within a service like Azure, then you will be in in a good position to complete your data protection plan, because you have a lot of previous services that have been done by Microsoft.
sd-       sd+       For example, Microsoft Azure Cloud has been a Secured by Design all as you can see, there are many, many, many solution features that you want, that you can apply.
sd--      sd-       So you can be sure that if you deploy one service in a European region, you are meeting the European laws, okay?
sd--      sd+       For example, regarding European laws, there is the famous or infamous article 29 of the EU working party saying that, or stating how data must be managed, okay, so if you deploy your servers in a region within Europe, you can be sure that all data is managed following, this kind of clauses, okay.
sd-       sd--      The same for the States and any other, any other law, laws and regulations that can apply.
sd+       sd-       And also, you can sign for a specific data protection addenda okay.
sd-       sd+       I just chose bigger samples that in order to to show that Azure is able to meet any kind of restriction, there is a specific slice or a specific part of Azure that is devoted to deploy United States government services.
sd-       sd+       It has been tested following different standards and a there are federal and local services that are being deployed in Azure cloud
sd--      sd-       thanks to these kind of a separate regions that are not shared with any other user just in this case for the US government.
sd-       sd+       You know that if you want to give services in China you need to follow specific rules relating with the owner of data, data grant access, audit etc.
sd--      sd+       So, you can even deploy your cloud services at China regional data centre, okay?
sd-       sd+       And the final it's a more complex walkthrough that is how to create an Azure policy, including network resource groups, sorry, network security groups, rules, laws, etcetera, etcetera.
sd--      sd-       So, in this module that I went very fast because as you see it's so theoretical  and maybe for you it's not that interesting
sd-       sd+       so we have seen different identity features and services, how to control the life circle of the resources and finally how to meet the different rules, standards and regulations of its area. In all of my slides, that you have already uploaded to Teams group, you have the learn path that you should follow if you decide to go through the certification exam, okay? So, my recommendation is that you take enough time, you read all the learn paths and you will be in a good position to complete the certification that as I said before, we will inform you in some days how to complete that. Okay, so, any doubt, any question?
